                                            A Glass of Milk Once, there was a poor boy who made a living by selling various objects from door to door. This was the way he earned money to pay for his school. One day, as he was walking from house to house as usual, he felt very hungry and weak. He felt that he couldn’t walk even a few steps. He decided to ask for food at a house. He knocked on the door and was stunned to see a beautiful young girl open the door. With much hesitation, he asked the girl for a glass of water. The young girl understood his condition and offered him a huge glass of milk. With an astonished look, the boy drank the milk very slowly. “How much do I owe you for this milk?” he asked her. The girl replied, “I do not want any money for this.” The boy thanked the girl from the bottom of his heart and left the place. Years passed by. The young girl grew up. In her youth, unfortunately, she fell ill and was diagnosed with the rarest kind of nervous disorder. Many experienced doctors were baffled at her condition, and she was admitted in the city hospital with the most advanced facilities. Dr. Kevin, a renowned neuro specialist was called in by the hospital to examine her. Even with his extraordinary expertise, Dr. Kevin found the girl’s illness very hard to cure. However, with perseverance and hard work that lasted months, he was finally able to get the disease under control. With careful medication and monitoring, the girl was completely cured in the end. Everyone praised the doctor, but the girl was quite worried about how much the hospital bill would come to. Her family had just a little money kept away in the bank, which was by no means enough to pay for such a long treatment in that reputed hospital. The girl was given the hospital bill finally. With trembling hands, she opened it. She was stunned to see that the bill had been crossed out and cancelled, and there was a note underneath signed by Dr. Kevin. “Bill paid years ago with a glass of milk!”what summary of the storycharacter of the storyconflict of the storyresulution of the story conflicttheme used on the storyinsight and reflection from the storyplss help me​</a>

                                            Insights and Reflections about the story a glass of milkOnce, there was a poor boy who made a living by selling various objectsfrom door to door. This was the way he earned money to pay for his school.One day, as he was walking from house to house as usual, he felt veryhungry and weak. He felt that he couldn’t walk even a few steps. Hedecided to ask for food at a house. He knocked on the door and wasstunned to see a beautiful young girl open the door. With much hesitation,he asked the girl for a glass of water.The young girl understood his condition and offered him a huge glass ofmilk. With an astonished look, the boy drank the milk very slowly.“How much do I owe you for this milk?” he asked her.The girl replied, “I do not want any money for this.”The boy thanked the girl from the bottom of his heart and left the place.Years passed by. The young girl grew up. In her youth, unfortunately, shefell ill and was diagnosed with the rarest kind of nervous disorder. Manyexperienced doctors were baffled at her condition, and she was admittedin the city hospital with the most advanced facilities.Dr. Kevin, a renowned neuro specialist was called in by the hospital toexamine her. Even with his extraordinary expertise,Dr. Kevin found the girl’s illness very hard to cure. However, withperseverance and hard work that lasted months, he was finally able to getthe disease under control. With careful medication and monitoring, the girlwas completely cured in the end.Everyone praised the doctor, but the girl was quite worried about howmuch the hospital bill would come to. Her family had just a little moneykept away in the bank, which was by no means enough to pay for such along treatment in that reputed hospital.The girl was given the hospital bill finally. With trembling hands, sheopened it. She was stunned to see that the bill had been crossed out andcancelled, and there was a note underneath signed by Dr. Kevin.“Bill paid years ago with a glass of milk!”​</a>

                            8. Insights and Reflections about the story a glass of milkOnce, there was a poor boy who made a living by selling various objectsfrom door to door. This was the way he earned money to pay for his school.One day, as he was walking from house to house as usual, he felt veryhungry and weak. He felt that he couldn’t walk even a few steps. Hedecided to ask for food at a house. He knocked on the door and wasstunned to see a beautiful young girl open the door. With much hesitation,he asked the girl for a glass of water.The young girl understood his condition and offered him a huge glass ofmilk. With an astonished look, the boy drank the milk very slowly.“How much do I owe you for this milk?” he asked her.The girl replied, “I do not want any money for this.”The boy thanked the girl from the bottom of his heart and left the place.Years passed by. The young girl grew up. In her youth, unfortunately, shefell ill and was diagnosed with the rarest kind of nervous disorder. Manyexperienced doctors were baffled at her condition, and she was admittedin the city hospital with the most advanced facilities.Dr. Kevin, a renowned neuro specialist was called in by the hospital toexamine her. Even with his extraordinary expertise,Dr. Kevin found the girl’s illness very hard to cure. However, withperseverance and hard work that lasted months, he was finally able to getthe disease under control. With careful medication and monitoring, the girlwas completely cured in the end.Everyone praised the doctor, but the girl was quite worried about howmuch the hospital bill would come to. Her family had just a little moneykept away in the bank, which was by no means enough to pay for such along treatment in that reputed hospital.The girl was given the hospital bill finally. With trembling hands, sheopened it. She was stunned to see that the bill had been crossed out andcancelled, and there was a note underneath signed by Dr. Kevin.“Bill paid years ago with a glass of milk!”​</h2><br />
