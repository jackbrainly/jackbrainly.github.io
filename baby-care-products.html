With public health threat expected to persist for months, alternative learning modes must be promoted.​</a>

                                            A. First,read this passage below.    A couple of years ago, Annette Sorensen, 30, an actress from Copenhagen, Denmark, and Exavier Wardlaw, 49, a movie production assistant from Brooklyn, NY, were arrested for leaving their 14-month-old daughter outside a Manhattan restaurant on a chilly day, while they ate inside the restaurant.  They left her in her baby carriage on the sidewalk.  Many passersby called 911 to alert the police.  New York authorities took the child away from her parents and temporarily placed her in foster care.   In an ensuing article in the New York Times, one Danish commentator observed that leaving a baby outside of a restaurant is a very common practice in Denmark.  The commentator wrote, “Often, Danish parents…leave their babies outside.  For one thing, Danish baby carriages are enormous.  Babies ride high above the world on horse-carriage-size wheels.  It’s hard to get such a carriage into a café…Besides, Danish cafes are very smoky places.”  The commentator continued, “In Denmark, people have an almost religious conviction that fresh air, preferably cold air, is good for children.  All Danish babies nap outside, even in freezing weather—tucked warmly under their plump goose-down comforters…In Denmark all children own a sort of polar survival suit that they wear from October to April, and they go out every day, even in winter.”After reading the passage, answer the following questions. 1.	How would you have responded to the situation if you were the only one on the street who witnessed the carriage by  itself?2.	Search for the defination of Ethnocentrism and where it may be present in this passage.  3.	Try to come up with an explanation for what you believe might be the definition or idea of Cultural Relativism. Identify where this idea may be present in this passage, or where it may be implied.​</a>

The warning labels on cigarette cartons tell the story: smoking can cause lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema, premature birth and injury to babies born to smokers. Yet, despite the dangers, cigarettes are readily available in convenience stores, gas stations, and liquor stores 2. Cigarettes are deadly; the risks are real; the benefits are nonexistent. The only way to stop the danger is to stop the sale of cigarettes altogether. 3. A new generation is emerging who have never known life without the internet or social media. How will their consumer behavior and spending patterns shape businesses in the future? And as more Gen Zs enter the workforce, how will their new ideas and approaches alter the workplace?4. Many students are scrambling-much like their professors to adopt to this virtual learning environment we have been abruptly tossed into. For some, this may be an easy, or perhaps even welcome, transition. That is dependent on several factors. The first factor, which cannot be understated, is the home-life of students who have transitioned back to their familial residences. Many students have chaotic homes, filled with family members who have been forced to work or attend school remotely. This puts a strain on internet capabilities as well, which further dampens the educational potential of these online courses.5. With scientists still trying to develop a COVID-19 vaccine and any possible cure still several months away from mass production, the consequences of reopening classes in the country's crowded need careful consideration. Technology allows remote learning, and efforts must be ramped up to make this universally accessible. With public health threat expected to persist for months, alternative learning modes must be promoted.​</h2><br />

                            11. A. First,read this passage below.    A couple of years ago, Annette Sorensen, 30, an actress from Copenhagen, Denmark, and Exavier Wardlaw, 49, a movie production assistant from Brooklyn, NY, were arrested for leaving their 14-month-old daughter outside a Manhattan restaurant on a chilly day, while they ate inside the restaurant.  They left her in her baby carriage on the sidewalk.  Many passersby called 911 to alert the police.  New York authorities took the child away from her parents and temporarily placed her in foster care.   In an ensuing article in the New York Times, one Danish commentator observed that leaving a baby outside of a restaurant is a very common practice in Denmark.  The commentator wrote, “Often, Danish parents…leave their babies outside.  For one thing, Danish baby carriages are enormous.  Babies ride high above the world on horse-carriage-size wheels.  It’s hard to get such a carriage into a café…Besides, Danish cafes are very smoky places.”  The commentator continued, “In Denmark, people have an almost religious conviction that fresh air, preferably cold air, is good for children.  All Danish babies nap outside, even in freezing weather—tucked warmly under their plump goose-down comforters…In Denmark all children own a sort of polar survival suit that they wear from October to April, and they go out every day, even in winter.”After reading the passage, answer the following questions. 1.	How would you have responded to the situation if you were the only one on the street who witnessed the carriage by  itself?2.	Search for the defination of Ethnocentrism and where it may be present in this passage.  3.	Try to come up with an explanation for what you believe might be the definition or idea of Cultural Relativism. Identify where this idea may be present in this passage, or where it may be implied.​</h2><br />
