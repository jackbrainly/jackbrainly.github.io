Can you name what type of salad is on the picture? 2. Can you describe the presentation of salad in the picture? 3. If you will be given a chance to prepare salad for the family, how are you going to present it? Why? Learning Task 2: Directions: Read the information about Factors and Techniques in Presenting and Plating Salads and Dressing 1. Choose salad greens that are fresh and crisp • One of the most desirable characteristics of vegetables intended to be eaten raw is crispiness of vegetables. In washing vegetables, soaked in cold water with a pinch of salt, then wash thoroughly in cold running water. Place in a colander and drain well. Greens that are wet when combined with the dressing can cause the dressing to dilute and tasteless. 2. Choose pleasing combinations with contrast in color, texture, form, size and flavor.​</a>

________1. Looking like giant mole hills, the Chocolate Hills are probably Bohol’s
most famous tourist attraction. Most people who first see the landscape in
pictures can hardly believe that these hills are natural artifact or not manmade. If this idea is true, then the effort of building them surely surpasses the
construction of the pyramids in Egypt. They are covered with grass, which at
the end of the dry season, turns into chocolate brown. It is from this color that
the name Chocolate Hills was derived. Be amazed with its beauty.
Book now and travel to Bohol with your family!
________2. The crocodile and the alligator are cousins. They both live in water and
on land. They almost look alike but with a little difference. The crocodile has a
narrower head. Its mouth is more pointed than the mouth of the alligator. The
crocodile is quicker and more dangerous than the alligator. Both animals eat
turtles, fish and other water animals. When grown up, they will eat almost any
kind of land or water animal up to the size of a deer.
_________3. Clouds are collections of millions of water droplets or ice crystals. They
are formed high above the Earth’s surface and sometimes at ground level. The
three main forms of clouds are cumulus, stratus, and cirrus. Their shapes are
clues to predicting weather. Cumulus clouds are puffy, with broad, flat bases. A
few small cumulus clouds signal fair weather. But tall, bulky cumulus clouds
called cumulonimbus can produce thunderstorms. Stratus clouds are flat,
sheetlike clouds They normally mean warm or possibly wet weather. Cirrus
clouds are wispy clouds found at great heights. So, the next time you leave the
house, look up the sky, observe the clouds, and find out whether you will bring
an umbrella or pack up a raincoat.
___________4. A cat is the perfect pet. Cats are really so cute. They make people happy
by petting. It reduces stress because they are calm. Having a cat will be easy. I
will feed the cat. Yosef can help me clean the litter box. We will help together
to feed Snow. A cat would make for the perfect pet. Please get me a cat, Mom
and Dad!

He begs for water, but no one answers his pleas until La Esmerelda comes forth and brings him something to drink. Nearby, a recluse called Sister Gudule, screams at La Esmerelda for being a "gypsy child- thief" and blames her for her daughter's kidnapping fifteen years earlier. A few months later, La Esmerelda is dancing in front of Notre Dame and Phoebus calls her over to him. She has fallen in love with him and blushes when he asks her to meet him later that night. Frollo watches them from the top of Notre Dame and becomes insanely jealous of Phoebus. His obsessive lust for La Esmerelda has made him renounce God and study alchemy and black magic. In his secret cell at Notre Dame, he plans to trap La Esmerelda like a spider catching a fly with its web. Later that night, he follows Phoebus to his tryst with La Esmerelda and stabs Phoebus repeatedly. He escapes and La Esmerelda is captured by the King's guard. After being tortured at her trial, La Esmerelda falsely confesses to killingPhoebus and being a witch. She is sentenced to hang in the Place de Grève. Frollo visits her in jail and declares his love. He begs her to love him and show him some pity but she calls him a "goblin-monk" and a murderer, refusing to have anything to do with him. Before her execution, La Esmerelda is publicly humiliated in front of Notre Dame. Looking across the square, she suddenly sees Phoebus and calls out his name. He actually survived the murder attempt but doesn't want anyone to know that he was injured. He turns away from La Esmerelda and enters the house of his brideto-be. Just then, Quasimodo swings down on a rope from Notre Dame and carries her back to the cathedral, crying out "Sanctuary!" He had fallen in love with her when she brought him water and had been planning her escape all along. La Esmerelda is safe from execution just as long as she stays inside thecathedral. At first, she finds it hard to even look at Quasimodo, but they form an uneasy friendship. Even though he is deaf, he enjoys being around her when she sings. Meanwhile, a group of vagabonds resolves to save La Esmerelda after hearing that Parliament has ordered that she will be removed from Notre Dame. But when Quasimodo sees them attack the cathedral, he thinks they have come to kill La Esmerelda and he fend them off as best he can, killing a large number of them. Frollo has used the attack as a diversion to sneak La Esmerelda out of the cathedral. He offers her two choices: she can either say she loves him or be hanged. She demands to be executed and he leaves her with Sister Gudule. To their astonishment, they discover that they are mother and daughter. Gudule tries to protect La Esmerelda, but it is too late. Back at Notre Dame, Quasimodo goes to the top of the north tower to find her. Gazing off into the distance, he sees the figure of La Esmerelda in a white dress hanging from the scaffold. He bellows out in despair and grabs Frollo by the neck. Holding him up in the air, Quasimodo sighs with grief and then throws Frollo down to his death. Looking at La Esmerelda hanging off in the distance and Frollo's wrangled corpse down below, Quasimodo cries out: "There is everything I ever loved!" Quasimodo is never seen again. Years later when a gravedigger stumbles across La Esmerelda's remains, he finds the skeleton of a hunchback curled around her. (https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/hunchback/summary/Guide Questions:1.

________1. Looking like giant mole hills, the Chocolate Hills are probably Bohol’s
most famous tourist attraction. Most people who first see the landscape in
pictures can hardly believe that these hills are natural artifact or not manmade. If this idea is true, then the effort of building them surely surpasses the
construction of the pyramids in Egypt. They are covered with grass, which at
the end of the dry season, turns into chocolate brown. It is from this color that
the name Chocolate Hills was derived. Be amazed with its beauty.
Book now and travel to Bohol with your family!
________2. The crocodile and the alligator are cousins. They both live in water and
on land. They almost look alike but with a little difference. The crocodile has a
narrower head. Its mouth is more pointed than the mouth of the alligator. The
crocodile is quicker and more dangerous than the alligator. Both animals eat
turtles, fish and other water animals. When grown up, they will eat almost any
kind of land or water animal up to the size of a deer.
_________3. Clouds are collections of millions of water droplets or ice crystals. They
are formed high above the Earth’s surface and sometimes at ground level. The
three main forms of clouds are cumulus, stratus, and cirrus. Their shapes are
clues to predicting weather. Cumulus clouds are puffy, with broad, flat bases. A
few small cumulus clouds signal fair weather. But tall, bulky cumulus clouds
called cumulonimbus can produce thunderstorms. Stratus clouds are flat,
sheetlike clouds They normally mean warm or possibly wet weather. Cirrus
clouds are wispy clouds found at great heights. So, the next time you leave the
house, look up the sky, observe the clouds, and find out whether you will bring
an umbrella or pack up a raincoat.
___________4. A cat is the perfect pet. Cats are really so cute. They make people happy
by petting. It reduces stress because they are calm. Having a cat will be easy. I
will feed the cat. Yosef can help me clean the litter box. We will help together
to feed Snow. A cat would make for the perfect pet. Please get me a cat, Mom
and Dad!

three main forms of clouds are cumulus, stratus, and cirrus. Their shapes are
clues to predicting weather. Cumulus clouds are puffy, with broad, flat bases. A
few small cumulus clouds signal fair weather. But tall, bulky cumulus clouds
called cumulonimbus can produce thunderstorms. Stratus clouds are flat,
sheetlike clouds They normally mean warm or possibly wet weather. Cirrus
clouds are wispy clouds found at great heights. So, the next time you leave the
house, look up the sky, observe the clouds, and find out whether you will bring
an umbrella or pack up a raincoat.
___________4. A cat is the perfect pet. Cats are really so cute. They make people happy
by petting. It reduces stress because they are calm. Having a cat will be easy. I

He begs for water, but no one answers his pleas until La Esmerelda comes forth and brings him something to drink. Nearby, a recluse called Sister Gudule, screams at La Esmerelda for being a "gypsy child- thief" and blames her for her daughter's kidnapping fifteen years earlier. A few months later, La Esmerelda is dancing in front of Notre Dame and Phoebus calls her over to him. She has fallen in love with him and blushes when he asks her to meet him later that night. Frollo watches them from the top of Notre Dame and becomes insanely jealous of Phoebus. His obsessive lust for La Esmerelda has made him renounce God and study alchemy and black magic. In his secret cell at Notre Dame, he plans to trap La Esmerelda like a spider catching a fly with its web. Later that night, he follows Phoebus to his tryst with La Esmerelda and stabs Phoebus repeatedly. He escapes and La Esmerelda is captured by the King's guard. After being tortured at her trial, La Esmerelda falsely confesses to killingPhoebus and being a witch. She is sentenced to hang in the Place de Grève. Frollo visits her in jail and declares his love. He begs her to love him and show him some pity but she calls him a "goblin-monk" and a murderer, refusing to have anything to do with him. Before her execution, La Esmerelda is publicly humiliated in front of Notre Dame. Looking across the square, she suddenly sees Phoebus and calls out his name. He actually survived the murder attempt but doesn't want anyone to know that he was injured. He turns away from La Esmerelda and enters the house of his brideto-be. Just then, Quasimodo swings down on a rope from Notre Dame and carries her back to the cathedral, crying out "Sanctuary!" He had fallen in love with her when she brought him water and had been planning her escape all along. La Esmerelda is safe from execution just as long as she stays inside thecathedral. At first, she finds it hard to even look at Quasimodo, but they form an uneasy friendship. Even though he is deaf, he enjoys being around her when she sings. Meanwhile, a group of vagabonds resolves to save La Esmerelda after hearing that Parliament has ordered that she will be removed from Notre Dame. But when Quasimodo sees them attack the cathedral, he thinks they have come to kill La Esmerelda and he fend them off as best he can, killing a large number of them. Frollo has used the attack as a diversion to sneak La Esmerelda out of the cathedral. He offers her two choices: she can either say she loves him or be hanged. She demands to be executed and he leaves her with Sister Gudule. To their astonishment, they discover that they are mother and daughter. Gudule tries to protect La Esmerelda, but it is too late. Back at Notre Dame, Quasimodo goes to the top of the north tower to find her. Gazing off into the distance, he sees the figure of La Esmerelda in a white dress hanging from the scaffold. He bellows out in despair and grabs Frollo by the neck. Holding him up in the air, Quasimodo sighs with grief and then throws Frollo down to his death. Looking at La Esmerelda hanging off in the distance and Frollo's wrangled corpse down below, Quasimodo cries out: "There is everything I ever loved!" Quasimodo is never seen again. Years later when a gravedigger stumbles across La Esmerelda's remains, he finds the skeleton of a hunchback curled around her. (https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/hunchback/summary/Guide Questions:1.

________1. Looking like giant mole hills, the Chocolate Hills are probably Bohol’s
most famous tourist attraction. Most people who first see the landscape in
pictures can hardly believe that these hills are natural artifact or not manmade. If this idea is true, then the effort of building them surely surpasses the
construction of the pyramids in Egypt. They are covered with grass, which at
the end of the dry season, turns into chocolate brown. It is from this color that
the name Chocolate Hills was derived. Be amazed with its beauty.

on land. They almost look alike but with a little difference. The crocodile has a
narrower head. Its mouth is more pointed than the mouth of the alligator. The
crocodile is quicker and more dangerous than the alligator. Both animals eat
turtles, fish and other water animals. When grown up, they will eat almost any
kind of land or water animal up to the size of a deer.
