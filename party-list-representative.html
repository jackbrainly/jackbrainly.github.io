                            11.

Defend your answer. a, government officials (elected) b. government employees c. teachers (public schools) d. weather forecasters e. party-list representatives in the Lower House of Congress​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>a. Government officials (elected) - It depends on the specific government officials being considered. Some elected officials may have specialized in a certain field prior to their election and therefore may be well-suited to their roles. For example, an elected official with a background in law may be well-suited to serve as a judge or attorney general. However, some elected officials may not have a specialization that directly relates to their role and may not be as well-suited to their position.</p><p></p><p>b. Government employees - Similar to government officials, government employees may or may not have specialized in a field related to their role. Some government employees may have specialized in fields such as finance or information technology, which are directly relevant to their role. Others may not have a specialized field of expertise, but may have acquired skills and experience that are relevant to their role.</p><p></p><p>c. Teachers (public schools) - Teachers are expected to have specialized in their subject matter and in the teaching profession. However, in some cases, they may not have a specific specialization relevant to their subject matter but they are still qualified to teach by virtue of obtaining a degree in Education.</p><p></p><p>d. Weather forecasters - Weather forecasters are expected to have specialized in fields such as meteorology and atmospheric science, in order to accurately predict and report on weather patterns.</p><p></p><p>e. Party-list representatives in the Lower House of Congress - Party-list representatives are elected based on the platforms and advocacies of their respective party-list groups. They may have specialized in fields such as law, education, health, labor, and the environment, which align with the agendas of their party-list groups. However, not all party-list representatives have specialized fields, but they may have acquired relevant experiences and knowledge in their advocacies.</p><p></p><p>In summary, while some workers may be distributed according to their specialization, others may not have a direct specialization but still possess relevant skills and experiences that allow them to effectively perform their roles.</p><p></p><p></p><br />
