                                            Around the World in Eighty Days by Jules Verne "...We start for Dover and Calais in ten minutes." A puzzled grin overspread Passepartout's round face; clearly he had not comprehended his master. "Monsieur is going to leave home?" "Yes," returned Phileas Fogg. "We are going round the world." Passepartout opened wide his eyes, raised his eyebrows, held up his hands, and seemed about to collapse, so overcome was he with stupefied astonishment. "Round the world!" he murmured. "In eighty days," responded Mr. Fogg. "So we haven't a moment to lose." "But the trunks?" gasped Passepartout, unconsciously swaying his head from right to left. "We'll have no trunks; only a carpet-bag, with two shirts and three pairs of stockings for me, and the same for you. We'll buy our clothes on the way. Bring down my mackintosh and traveling-cloak, Word 1. overspread 2. returned 3. stupefied 4. carpet-bag 5. mackintosh 6. stout 7. native 8. chary 9. hitherto 10. wardrobes part of speech and some stout shoes, though we shall do little walking. Make haste!" Passepartout mechanically set about making the preparations for departure. Around the world in eighty days! Was his master a fool? No. Was this a joke, then? They were going to Dover; good! To Calais; good again! After all, Passepartout, who had been away from France five years, would not be sorry to set foot on his native soil again. Perhaps they would go as far as Paris, and it would do his eyes good to see Paris once more. But surely a gentleman so chary of his steps would stop there; no doubt-but, then, it was none the less true that he was going away, this so domestic person hitherto! By eight o'clock Passepartout had packed the modest carpet-bag, containing the wardrobes of his master and himself; then, still troubled in mind, he carefully shut the door of his room, and descended to Mr. Fogg. What do you think it means? What were your clues?​</a>

So the man put the boy on the donkey and went on their way. But soon they passed a group of men, one of whom said, “See that lazy boy, he lets his father walk while he rides.”So the man ordered his boy to get off and got on himself. But they hadn’t far when they passed three women, one of whom said to the other, “Shame on that lazy old  man to let his poor little son walk along.”  Well, the man didn’t know what to do, but at last, he took his Boy up before him on the donkey. By this time they had come to the town, and the passerby began to tease and point at them. The man stopped and asked why. The man said, “Aren’t you ashamed of yourself for overloading that poor donkey with you and your son?”The man and the boy got off and tried to think about what to do. They thought and they thought, till at last, they cut down a pole tied the donkey’s feet to it, and raised the pole and the donkey to their shoulders. They went along in the middle of the laughter of all who met them till they came to Market Bridge. The donkey, getting one of his feet loose, kicked out and caused the boy to drop his end of the pole. In the struggle, the donkey fell over the bridge, and with his feet tied together, he drowned. “That will teach you,” said an old man who had followed them: “Please all, and you will please none.”Answer the following questions:1.

So the man put the boy on the donkey and went on their way. But soon they passed a group of men, one of whom said, “See that lazy boy, he lets his father walk while he rides.”So the man ordered his boy to get off and got on himself. But they hadn’t far when they passed three women, one of whom said to the other, “Shame on that lazy old  man to let his poor little son walk along.”  Well, the man didn’t know what to do, but at last, he took his Boy up before him on the donkey. By this time they had come to the town, and the passerby began to tease and point at them. The man stopped and asked why. The man said, “Aren’t you ashamed of yourself for overloading that poor donkey with you and your son?”The man and the boy got off and tried to think about what to do. They thought and they thought, till at last, they cut down a pole tied the donkey’s feet to it, and raised the pole and the donkey to their shoulders. They went along in the middle of the laughter of all who met them till they came to Market Bridge. The donkey, getting one of his feet loose, kicked out and caused the boy to drop his end of the pole. In the struggle, the donkey fell over the bridge, and with his feet tied together, he drowned. “That will teach you,” said an old man who had followed them: “Please all, and you will please none.”Answer the following questions:1.

                                            Using Context Clues with Literature Jules Verne published "Around the World in Eighey Days" in 1873. It's the story of English gendeman Phineas Fogg who takes a bet that he can travel around the world in eighty days. This was almost impossible in those days with limited railroads and no ar travel at all. The passage below is when Fogg tells his servant Passepartout to prepare for the trip. Read the passage and pay special attention to the underlined words. Complete the grid at the bottom of the page. Around the World in Eighty Days by Jules Verne "We start for Dover and Calais in ten minutes." A puzzled grin overspread Passepartout's round face; clearly he had not comprehended his master "Monsieur is going to leave home?" "Yes." surned Phileas Fogg. We are going round the world." Passepartout opened wide his eyes, rassed his eyebrows, held up his hands, and seemed about to collapse, so overcome was be with stupchied astonishment. "Round the world!" he murmured. "In eighty days," responded Mr. Fogg. "So we haven't a moment to lose." Name: "But the trunks?" gasped Passepartout. unconsciously swaying his head from right to left. "We'll have no trunks; only a carpet-bag, with two shirts and three pairs of stockings for me, and the same for you. We'll buy our clothes on the way. Bring down my mackintosh and traveling-cloak, and some stout shoes, though we shall do little walking. Make haste!" Passepartout mechanically set about making the preparations for departure. Around the world in eighty days! Was his master a fool? No. Was this a joke, then? They were going to Dover: good' To Calais, good again! After all. Passepartout. who had been away from France hive years, would not be sorry to set foot on his native soil again. Perhaps they would go as far as Paris, and it would do his eyes good to see Paris once more. But surely a gentleman so chary of his steps would stop there; no doubt-but, then, it was none the less true that he was going away, this so domestic person hitherto! By eight o'clock Passepartout had packed the modest carpet-bag, containing the wardrobes of his master and himself; then, still troubled in mind, he carefully shut the door of his room, and descended to Mr. Fogg.​</a>

                                            The Hill We Climb" by Amanda GormanWhen day comes we ask ourselves, where can we find light in this never-endingshade? The loss we carry, a sea we must wade. We've braved the belly of the beast,we've learned that quiet isn't always peace and the norms and notions of what just is,isn't always justice. And yet the dawn is ours before we knew it, somehow we do it,somehow we've weathered and witnessed a nation that isn't broken but simplyunfinished.We, the successors of a country and a time where a skinny black girl descended fromslaves and raised by a single mother can dream of becoming president only to findherself reciting for one. And, yes, we are far from polished, far from pristine, but thatdoesn't mean we are striving to form a union that is perfect, we are striving to forge aunion with purpose, to compose a country committed to all cultures, colors, charactersand conditions of man.So we lift our gazes not to what stands between us, but what stands before us. Weclose the divide because we know to put our future first, we must first put our differencesaside. We lay down our arms so we can reach out our arms to one another, we seekharm to none and harmony for all.Let the globe, if nothing else, say this is true: that even as we grieved, we grew, evenas we hurt, we hoped, that even as we tired, we tried, that we'll forever be tied togethervictorious, not because we will never again know defeat but hecause we will​</a>

As a learner-centred process approach to second language (L2) writing, peer response has been widely adopted and studied since the 1990s (Hyland &amp; Hyland, 2006). The dialogic nature of peer response seems to foster multiple support systems (Hyland, 2000) and communicative behaviours (Villamil &amp; de Guerrero, 1996). L2 research has shown that peer response can increase chances for meaning negotiation and language practice (Lockhart &amp; Ng, 1995; Mendonca &amp; Johnson, 1994), encourage collaborative reading and writing (Tsui &amp; Ng, 2000), and promote writing revisions (Berg, 1999; Mendonca &amp; Johnson, 1994; Min, 2006, 2008; Stanley, 1992). These interactive practices appear to draw upon and enhance interactional and writing skills. A Academic Text C. All answers are Correct B. Not Academic Text D. None of the above 3. The story of the Bible in translation is, like the text itself, far from straightforward. Private spiritual reading may well have lain at the heart of Protestant piety but, as Lori Anne Ferrell has pointed out, the Bible was desperately difficult to understand and Protestant writers of biblical text-books knew this only too well. Their approach was to warn readers of the 'knotty Passages' and 'things hard to be understood' whilst, at the same time, steering them to the 'Shallows where the Lambs may wade' with the assurance (and encouragement) that the Truths necessary to Salvation are plain, and of easy access to the weakest understanding.

Viruses also harbor the majority ofgenetic diversity on Earth Scientists are finding evidence of viruses as a planetary force, influencing the globalclimate and geochemical cycles. They have also profoundly shaped the evolution of their hosts. The humangenome, for example,.contains 100.000 segments of virus DNA28 - 30When mice are kept at high population densities, their behavior changes in a number of waysAggressive activity within populations of mice rises as density increases. Cannibalism of young also goes up.and so does aberrant sexual activity. Communal nesting, frequent in natural mouse populations, increasesabnormally. In one example, 58 mice one to three days old (from several litters) were found in one nest, mostunusual communal living.

                            5. Around the World in Eighty Days by Jules Verne "...We start for Dover and Calais in ten minutes." A puzzled grin overspread Passepartout's round face; clearly he had not comprehended his master. "Monsieur is going to leave home?" "Yes," returned Phileas Fogg. "We are going round the world." Passepartout opened wide his eyes, raised his eyebrows, held up his hands, and seemed about to collapse, so overcome was he with stupefied astonishment. "Round the world!" he murmured. "In eighty days," responded Mr. Fogg. "So we haven't a moment to lose." "But the trunks?" gasped Passepartout, unconsciously swaying his head from right to left. "We'll have no trunks; only a carpet-bag, with two shirts and three pairs of stockings for me, and the same for you. We'll buy our clothes on the way. Bring down my mackintosh and traveling-cloak, Word 1. overspread 2. returned 3. stupefied 4. carpet-bag 5. mackintosh 6. stout 7. native 8. chary 9. hitherto 10. wardrobes part of speech and some stout shoes, though we shall do little walking. Make haste!" Passepartout mechanically set about making the preparations for departure. Around the world in eighty days! Was his master a fool? No. Was this a joke, then? They were going to Dover; good! To Calais; good again! After all, Passepartout, who had been away from France five years, would not be sorry to set foot on his native soil again. Perhaps they would go as far as Paris, and it would do his eyes good to see Paris once more. But surely a gentleman so chary of his steps would stop there; no doubt-but, then, it was none the less true that he was going away, this so domestic person hitherto! By eight o'clock Passepartout had packed the modest carpet-bag, containing the wardrobes of his master and himself; then, still troubled in mind, he carefully shut the door of his room, and descended to Mr. Fogg.

So the man put the boy on the donkey and went on their way. But soon they passed a group of men, one of whom said, “See that lazy boy, he lets his father walk while he rides.”So the man ordered his boy to get off and got on himself. But they hadn’t far when they passed three women, one of whom said to the other, “Shame on that lazy old  man to let his poor little son walk along.”  Well, the man didn’t know what to do, but at last, he took his Boy up before him on the donkey. By this time they had come to the town, and the passerby began to tease and point at them. The man stopped and asked why. The man said, “Aren’t you ashamed of yourself for overloading that poor donkey with you and your son?”The man and the boy got off and tried to think about what to do. They thought and they thought, till at last, they cut down a pole tied the donkey’s feet to it, and raised the pole and the donkey to their shoulders. They went along in the middle of the laughter of all who met them till they came to Market Bridge. The donkey, getting one of his feet loose, kicked out and caused the boy to drop his end of the pole. In the struggle, the donkey fell over the bridge, and with his feet tied together, he drowned. “That will teach you,” said an old man who had followed them: “Please all, and you will please none.”Answer the following questions:1.

It's the story of English gendeman Phineas Fogg who takes a bet that he can travel around the world in eighty days. This was almost impossible in those days with limited railroads and no ar travel at all. The passage below is when Fogg tells his servant Passepartout to prepare for the trip. Read the passage and pay special attention to the underlined words. Complete the grid at the bottom of the page. Around the World in Eighty Days by Jules Verne "We start for Dover and Calais in ten minutes." A puzzled grin overspread Passepartout's round face; clearly he had not comprehended his master "Monsieur is going to leave home?" "Yes." surned Phileas Fogg. We are going round the world."

There is so much more to college than the classes you take. Not only does university help you grow academically and professionally, but also as an individual. That, in my opinion, is a beautiful thing. Here’s what I have learned this semester.</p><p><strong>If none yet, then, how do you encourage and motivate yourself and other people?</strong></p><p>You can only motivate and inspire your team if they know what they are working towards. Make sure your employees are aware of your vision and what your ultimate goals are for the business. This encourages everyone to work together to achieve better results. As well as this, regularly set clear and measurable goals that are framed by this vision so that you and your teams can track progress and they are able to see their success in a tangible way. Supporting alignment within and across teams cultivates increased productivity and can help employees to feel valued and motivated.</p><p>Pa brainliest. done.</p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>The background of the study provides insights to the motivations and perspectives of the researcher.

                            19. The Hill We Climb" by Amanda GormanWhen day comes we ask ourselves, where can we find light in this never-endingshade? The loss we carry, a sea we must wade. We've braved the belly of the beast,we've learned that quiet isn't always peace and the norms and notions of what just is,isn't always justice. And yet the dawn is ours before we knew it, somehow we do it,somehow we've weathered and witnessed a nation that isn't broken but simplyunfinished.We, the successors of a country and a time where a skinny black girl descended fromslaves and raised by a single mother can dream of becoming president only to findherself reciting for one. And, yes, we are far from polished, far from pristine, but thatdoesn't mean we are striving to form a union that is perfect, we are striving to forge aunion with purpose, to compose a country committed to all cultures, colors, charactersand conditions of man.So we lift our gazes not to what stands between us, but what stands before us. Weclose the divide because we know to put our future first, we must first put our differencesaside. We lay down our arms so we can reach out our arms to one another, we seekharm to none and harmony for all.Let the globe, if nothing else, say this is true: that even as we grieved, we grew, evenas we hurt, we hoped, that even as we tired, we tried, that we'll forever be tied togethervictorious, not because we will never again know defeat but hecause we will​</h2><br />

As a learner-centred process approach to second language (L2) writing, peer response has been widely adopted and studied since the 1990s (Hyland &amp; Hyland, 2006). The dialogic nature of peer response seems to foster multiple support systems (Hyland, 2000) and communicative behaviours (Villamil &amp; de Guerrero, 1996). L2 research has shown that peer response can increase chances for meaning negotiation and language practice (Lockhart &amp; Ng, 1995; Mendonca &amp; Johnson, 1994), encourage collaborative reading and writing (Tsui &amp; Ng, 2000), and promote writing revisions (Berg, 1999; Mendonca &amp; Johnson, 1994; Min, 2006, 2008; Stanley, 1992).

The story of the Bible in translation is, like the text itself, far from straightforward. Private spiritual reading may well have lain at the heart of Protestant piety but, as Lori Anne Ferrell has pointed out, the Bible was desperately difficult to understand and Protestant writers of biblical text-books knew this only too well. Their approach was to warn readers of the 'knotty Passages' and 'things hard to be understood' whilst, at the same time, steering them to the 'Shallows where the Lambs may wade' with the assurance (and encouragement) that the Truths necessary to Salvation are plain, and of easy access to the weakest understanding.

SUMMARIZING KEY INFORMATIONDirections: Read, analyze and write a three-sentence summary for each paragraph.25 - 27Scientists' research has revealed that viruses are by far the most abundant life forms on Earth. Thereare a million times more viruses on the planet than stars in the universe. Viruses also harbor the majority ofgenetic diversity on Earth Scientists are finding evidence of viruses as a planetary force, influencing the globalclimate and geochemical cycles. They have also profoundly shaped the evolution of their hosts. The humangenome, for example,.contains 100.000 segments of virus DNA28 - 30When mice are kept at high population densities, their behavior changes in a number of waysAggressive activity within populations of mice rises as density increases. Cannibalism of young also goes up.and so does aberrant sexual activity. Communal nesting, frequent in natural mouse populations, increasesabnormally. In one example, 58 mice one to three days old (from several litters) were found in one nest, mostunusual communal living. None survived because most of the mothers deserted them immediately after birth.​</h2><br />

                            30. The Old Man, His Son and a DonkeyA man and his son were once going with their donkey to market.As they were walking along by its side, a countryman passed themand said, "You fools, what a donkey for but to ride is upon?"So the man put the boy on the donkey and went on their way. Butsoon they passed a group of men, one of whom said, "See that lazyboy, he lets his father walk while he rides."So the man ordered his boy to get off, and got on himself Butthey had not gone far when they passed two women, one of whomsaid to the other: "Shame on that lazy old man to let his poor littleson walk along. "Well, the Man didn't know what to do, but at last hetook his Boy up before him on the donkey. By this time, they hadcome to the town, and the passersby began to tease and point atthem. The man stopped and asked why. The men said, "Aren't youashamed of yourself for overloading that poor donkey with you andyour son?"The man and the boy got off and tried to think what to do. Theythought and they thought, till at last they cut down a pole, tied thedonkey's feet to it, and raised the pole and the donkey to theirshoulders. They went along in the middle of the laughter of all whomet them till they came to Market Bridge, when the donkey, gettingone of his feet loose, kicked out, and caused the boy to drop his endof the pole. In the struggle, the donkey fell over the bridge, and withhis feet tied together, he drowned. “That will teach you," said an oldman who had followed them: "Please all, and you will please none."Source: English 4 Learner's Material p. 56-57HINDI IPINAGBIBILIPag-aari ng Pamahalaan​</h2><br />
