Global warming is becoming a more serious problem and has become a threat to our planet. So I will tell you how we can stop global warming.Global warming is making our world a dangerous place and it is destroying the world. Global warming is caused by the greenhouse gases that are left by factories, cars, motorbikes etc. The air is polluted from factory emissions and car exhaust. Because of the greenhouse gases there is acid rain. Acid rain destroys lakes and rivers and affects the fish and wildlife. Due to global warming the ozone layer is depleting and the harmful ultraviolet rays are reaching the earth. This causes the glaciers and icebergs to melt.First, we have work together to reduce, reuse and recycle to stop the causes of global warming. One of the things we could do is recycle more. Recycling is the process in which we could reuse things like cardboard, plastic bottles and plastic bags. For example we could use both sides of a piece of paper. Even more useful, would be to buy washable water bottles that can be reused. Finally we can buy goods with less packaging and we could carry cloth bags to carry our groceries and purchases instead of wasting plastic bags.Next we need to find more different types of energy to use as another step to stop the effects of global warming. Using more solar, wind and hydroelectric power would reduce pollution and consumption of fossil fuels. Less gas and coal would be burned if people used alternate power sources. As well we can use public transport instead of driving alone in individual cars. If people prefer not to take the bus or train they could walk or ride a bike. There are other ways to put global warming in check. One is to plant more trees and stop deforesting. More trees produce more oxygen which benefits the ozone layer. Another way is to switch off electrical equipment when not in use would stop the wastage of precious electricity.When people think about the concequences and how to help to prevent global warming and take action we could stop global warming. This would make our world a wonderful place to live.questions:1.how did you validate the accuracy and credibility of the highlighted information?2.why is it important to ensure and confirm the accuracy and credibility of the information that you just red?ps:answer it im just doing this for fun​</a>

Political GlobalizationRefers to the amount of political co-operation thatexists between different countries. This ties in withthe belief that "umbrella" global organizations arebetter placed than individual states to preventconflict. The League of Nations established afterWW1 was certainly one of the pioneers in this. Sincethen, global organizations such as the World TradeOrganization (WTO), United Nations (UN), and moreregional organizations such as the EU have helped to increase the degree ofpolitical globalization​</a>

Climate is the overall atmospheric condition of a place for a period of 30 years or more. 2. The closer the place is to the equator, the warmer the climate is. 3. Air temperature decreases when altitude decreased. 4. Mountain ranges does not affect the formation of precipitation. 5. La Nina occurs when the temperature in western Pacific decreases below normal. 6. Bodies of water help regulate the climate of a certain area. 7. When the ocean current carries cold water the air above it becomes warmer. 8. The altitude of a place will affect the air temperature. 9. Places that are not always vertically hit by the sun's rays experience warm climate. 10. The climate of the place is influence by the surrounding bodies of water. 11. Air above the above the warm water has lower temperature. 12. When warm ocean currents that take along warm water go to a landmass, the temperature of that place increases as warmer air above the water flows inland, resulting in a warm climate. 13. Burning of fossil fuels is one of the main sources of carbon dioxide. 14. Solar radiation warms the Earth as its energy is absorbed by the atmosphere. 15. More greenhouse gases will result in the increase of global temperature.​</a>

                            5. pls read the essay before you answer.. and highlight this essay, then explain the level of accuracy of the highlighted information you just did.Have you ever listened about global warming? Global warming is becoming a more serious problem and has become a threat to our planet. So I will tell you how we can stop global warming.Global warming is making our world a dangerous place and it is destroying the world. Global warming is caused by the greenhouse gases that are left by factories, cars, motorbikes etc. The air is polluted from factory emissions and car exhaust. Because of the greenhouse gases there is acid rain. Acid rain destroys lakes and rivers and affects the fish and wildlife. Due to global warming the ozone layer is depleting and the harmful ultraviolet rays are reaching the earth. This causes the glaciers and icebergs to melt.First, we have work together to reduce, reuse and recycle to stop the causes of global warming. One of the things we could do is recycle more. Recycling is the process in which we could reuse things like cardboard, plastic bottles and plastic bags. For example we could use both sides of a piece of paper. Even more useful, would be to buy washable water bottles that can be reused. Finally we can buy goods with less packaging and we could carry cloth bags to carry our groceries and purchases instead of wasting plastic bags.Next we need to find more different types of energy to use as another step to stop the effects of global warming. Using more solar, wind and hydroelectric power would reduce pollution and consumption of fossil fuels. Less gas and coal would be burned if people used alternate power sources. As well we can use public transport instead of driving alone in individual cars. If people prefer not to take the bus or train they could walk or ride a bike. There are other ways to put global warming in check. One is to plant more trees and stop deforesting. More trees produce more oxygen which benefits the ozone layer. Another way is to switch off electrical equipment when not in use would stop the wastage of precious electricity.When people think about the concequences and how to help to prevent global warming and take action we could stop global warming. This would make our world a wonderful place to live.questions:1.how did you validate the accuracy and credibility of the highlighted information?2.why is it important to ensure and confirm the accuracy and credibility of the information that you just red?ps:answer it im just doing this for fun​</h2><br />

This ties in withthe belief that "umbrella" global organizations arebetter placed than individual states to preventconflict. The League of Nations established afterWW1 was certainly one of the pioneers in this. Sincethen, global organizations such as the World TradeOrganization (WTO), United Nations (UN), and moreregional organizations such as the EU have helped to increase the degree ofpolitical globalization​</h2><br />

Why doesn't air mass always remain in one place?5. How does global warming affect the weather changes in thePhilippines?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.Changes in weather are primarily result of a change in temperature, air pressure, and humidity in the atmosphere. ... For example, a sudden drop or rise in temperature can cause a significant contrast in the air pressure of neighboring air masses, which can result in strong and gusty winds.</p><p>2.Atmospheric pressure is an indicator of weather. When a low-pressure system moves into an area, it usually leads to cloudiness, wind, and precipitation. High-pressure systems usually lead to fair, calm weather. A barometer measures atmospheric pressure, which is also called barometric pressure</p><p>3.Cold weather fronts usually move from northwest to southeast. The air behind a cold front is colder and drier than the air in front. When a cold front passes through, temperatures can drop more than 15 degrees within an hour. ... When a warm front passes, the air becomes noticeably warmer and more humid than it was before.</p><p>4.Answer: An air mass, then, is named by the combination of its humidity and temperature designation. ... The very cold high latitude air does not hold much moisture and does not have heavy evaporation or precipitation, so mA air is also not found.</p><p>5.The Philippines is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, including sea level rise, increased frequency of extreme weather events, rising temperatures and extreme rainfall.</p><br />

When contrasted to lower air pressure, higher pressure allows more gas, such as oxygen, to dissolve in water. At sea level, for example, more oxygen is dissolved in water than at high altitudes.</p><p>3.Fronts of cold weather normally migrate from the northwest to the southeast. The air behind a cold front is colder and drier than that which before it. Temperatures can drop more than 15 degrees in an hour when a cold front moves through. When a warm front sweeps through, the air gets considerably warmer and more humid.</p><p>4.An air mass has roughly the same temperature and humidity.

One vital aspect of globalization is the formation of global cities. These cities serve as medium to
facilitate processes and flows while perpetuating the phenomenon of globalization.</h2><br />
                        <p>Dear President of the Philippines,</p><p></p><p>I am writing to propose that my own global city, Manila, be considered as a global city. As a global city, Manila would be a hub for international trade, tourism, and political activity.</p><p>To make Manila a world-class destination, we would need to invest in <strong>infrastructure</strong> that would support our growth as a global city. This would include <strong>building</strong> modern airports, high-speed rail lines, and highways to connect Manila to other major cities around the world. We would also need to<strong> invest</strong> in public transportation, including buses, trains, and subways, to make it easy for residents and visitors to get around the city.</p><p>To attract <strong>human capital</strong> and <strong>tourists</strong> to Manila, we would need to focus on providing a high quality of life for residents. This would include investing in education, healthcare, and other services that would make Manila an attractive place to live and work. We would also need to promote Manila as a tourist destination, highlighting our unique culture, history, and attractions.</p><p>To properly showcase Manila's culture, we would need to invest in the arts and <strong>cultural institutions</strong>. This could include funding for museums, galleries, theaters, and other <strong>cultural organizations</strong>. We would also need to support local artists and musicians, and create opportunities for them to showcase their work.</p><p>To make Manila a hub for <strong>political conferences</strong>, we would need to build modern conference centers and hotels that could accommodate large groups of people. We would also need to create a favorable environment for political discussions and negotiations, and provide support for organizations that host <strong>political events</strong> in Manila.</p><p>To address the challenges and issues that may arise as Manila grows as a global city, we would need to <strong>develop strategies</strong> and policies that would address issues such as traffic congestion, pollution, and housing affordability. We would also need to work closely with local, national, and international organizations to <strong>address these challenges</strong> and ensure that Manila remains a thriving and vibrant global city.</p><p>Thank you for considering Manila as a global city. I believe that with the right investments and support, Manila has the potential to become a <strong>world-class destination</strong> for trade, tourism, and political activity.</p><p></p><p>Sincerely,</p><p></p><p>Your Name</p><p></p><p><strong>THE SUMMARY</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Global cities</strong> are commerce, banking, and communication centres. They produce and exchange ideas, goods, and services and are considered economic growth engines.</p><p>Global cities have diversified <strong>demographics</strong>, <strong>cultural influences</strong>, and <strong>great connectivity</strong> with other cities.
