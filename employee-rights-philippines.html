                                            pa-summarize poRELATD STUDIES (LOCAL)The Philippines has earned its ranking as one of few gay-friendly countries in the world (Tubeza, 2013). A global survey said that Philippines say that homosexuality should be accepted in society (Pew Research Center, 2013). Despite its religiosity, the Philippines is one of the countries in the world where the level of public “acceptance” of homosexuals is high, according to the results of the survey (Statista, 2016). According to the survey, 78% of those aged 18-29 who interviewed said that gays should be accepted. 71 percent for those aged 30-49, and 68 percent for those 50 years old and above. A survey published by Statista Research Department in 2016, over 60 percent of the respondents do personally know are LGBT. However, only 25% of the respondents says that they support the legalization of same sex marriage. The Social Weather Survey also had the same result, 61% of their respondents says that they are disagree of legalization of same-sex marriage. Based on the result of the study of Ocampo (2016), LGBTQ members agreed that going through the phase of being confused to bisexual was hard for them at first and yet as they accept themselves and from the people around them, they became comfortable of whom they are. But discrimination cannot be prevented in their life as a bisexual such as insults or getting teased. They had experienced discrimination everywhere.In School, some teachers appeared to impose their own personal values and used institutional rules to suppress people’s gender expression, including giving students lower grades than they deserved (IGLHRC, 2013). Many of the LGBT women said they felt pressured to alter their preferred gender expression while at school and while wearing school uniforms. They reported that some officials explicitly sought to change their behavior. However, according to the UNDP, USAID (2014), the Department of Education in 2012 issued an order to protect children from violence, abuse and exploitation regardless of sexual orientation and gender identity which protects their rights as students. Some also said that even in their workplace, they have experienced discrimination. Despite being educated and have better qualification, they are often denied because of their gender (IGLHRC 2013). The UNDP, USAID (2014) also said that the employers sometimes take advantage of LGBT employees. Sexual harassment of LGBT employees was reported.In addition, Ocampo (2016), the LGBT people became more open minded and got more friends same as their sexuality for being a bisexual. However, Ocampo added that being different from others did not stop them from showing their true selves for there are people who would still accept and love them for who they are.LGBTQ also experienced violence inside and outside of their family. According to International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission (2013), they have experienced different violence such as physical, Verbal and Emotional Violence, Violence in the Name of Religion, Violence in Schools and Sexual violence. They’ve experienced this kind of violence are largely came from their own family members, significant others or ex-partners, co-workers, and strangers (International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission 2013).​</a>

                            13. pa-summarize poRELATD STUDIES (LOCAL)The Philippines has earned its ranking as one of few gay-friendly countries in the world (Tubeza, 2013). A global survey said that Philippines say that homosexuality should be accepted in society (Pew Research Center, 2013). Despite its religiosity, the Philippines is one of the countries in the world where the level of public “acceptance” of homosexuals is high, according to the results of the survey (Statista, 2016). According to the survey, 78% of those aged 18-29 who interviewed said that gays should be accepted. 71 percent for those aged 30-49, and 68 percent for those 50 years old and above. A survey published by Statista Research Department in 2016, over 60 percent of the respondents do personally know are LGBT. However, only 25% of the respondents says that they support the legalization of same sex marriage. The Social Weather Survey also had the same result, 61% of their respondents says that they are disagree of legalization of same-sex marriage. Based on the result of the study of Ocampo (2016), LGBTQ members agreed that going through the phase of being confused to bisexual was hard for them at first and yet as they accept themselves and from the people around them, they became comfortable of whom they are. But discrimination cannot be prevented in their life as a bisexual such as insults or getting teased. They had experienced discrimination everywhere.In School, some teachers appeared to impose their own personal values and used institutional rules to suppress people’s gender expression, including giving students lower grades than they deserved (IGLHRC, 2013). Many of the LGBT women said they felt pressured to alter their preferred gender expression while at school and while wearing school uniforms. They reported that some officials explicitly sought to change their behavior. However, according to the UNDP, USAID (2014), the Department of Education in 2012 issued an order to protect children from violence, abuse and exploitation regardless of sexual orientation and gender identity which protects their rights as students. Some also said that even in their workplace, they have experienced discrimination. Despite being educated and have better qualification, they are often denied because of their gender (IGLHRC 2013). The UNDP, USAID (2014) also said that the employers sometimes take advantage of LGBT employees. Sexual harassment of LGBT employees was reported.In addition, Ocampo (2016), the LGBT people became more open minded and got more friends same as their sexuality for being a bisexual. However, Ocampo added that being different from others did not stop them from showing their true selves for there are people who would still accept and love them for who they are.LGBTQ also experienced violence inside and outside of their family. According to International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission (2013), they have experienced different violence such as physical, Verbal and Emotional Violence, Violence in the Name of Religion, Violence in Schools and Sexual violence. They’ve experienced this kind of violence are largely came from their own family members, significant others or ex-partners, co-workers, and strangers (International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission 2013).​</h2><br />
