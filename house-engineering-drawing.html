But against all odds, the Filipino family are assertive and prepared all the time not only in terms of financial management but also housing and building of sturdy and safe places to live in during times of hazards. For this activity you are given the chance to construct a small model of a shelter that will help you to keepyour family safe during your chosen natural hazard. You can put colors unto it or sketch/ draw it using charcoal rendering techniques or any taste of art you want. You can also put labels/ parte for your houses/ shelter. Do this in a short bond paper. Template is shown below. An evaluative rubric will be provided for you. Then explain why you have drawn or sketched this shelter for your  family.
