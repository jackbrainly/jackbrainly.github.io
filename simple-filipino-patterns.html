The lyrics are according to the native tongue.Because songs are based on the daily experiences of the peoplein aplace and the message of the songs needs to be understood easily to be appreciated,the lyrics of the songs are written or sung in their own dialects. For example, theTagalog folk songs came from the people who speak Tagalog (Bahay Kubo, Leron,Leron Sinta, Magtanim ay Di Biro). The Ilocanos have their own (Manang Biday andSarung Banggi are just a few among the folk songs of Luzon that are sung in theirPamulinawen).

Viruses refer to infectious microscopic organisms that multiply only in living cells ofanimals, plants, or bacteria. They replicate themselves by integrating into the cell. When thishappens, the virus uses the cell's chemical machinery to keep itself alive. Viruses are responsible forcausing many diseases such as measles, chicken pox, common colds, SARS, and COVID-19. Inconclusion, viruses are microorganisms that harm other living things.7. It is definitely frightful to be infected with COVID-19. Though a large number ofpatients experience mild symptoms, turning it to a severe condition is still a possibility. I could notimagine a patient to experience chest pain, loss of speech or movement, and difficulty in breathingWhat is worse is the patient is all alone when he or she experiences all these struggles. Furthermore,anxiety and self-pity add to the struggle of the patients. Therefore, in order to avoid such conditions,let us not put our guards down from COVID-198. Cooking spaghert is very simple.

Crocodiles came from the family of Crocodilia while alligators came from the familyof Alligatoridae. In terms of their habitat, crocodiles prefer to live in saltwater while alligators live infreshwater like rivers and lakes. The main reason for this geographical separation is that Crocodileshave well-developed salt glands on their tongue that expel large amounts of sait, enabling them tolive in more salty waters. However, alligators' salt glands don't function well, leading them to stick tofreshwater habitats. Another way to differentiate the two is by looking at the shape of their snoutsCracodiles have long pointed V shaped snouts while alligators have rounded U-shaped snouts. Thesefeatures make crocodiles and alligators distinct from each other.10. Despite the problems brought by the pandemic, it has undeniably cultivated certainFilipino values. Because of the situation, family ties have been strengthened. Filipinos have valuedmore the presence of the family members and enjoy the time together. Also, the crisis made theirfaith to God stronger. Further, they have better realized the importance of proper hygiene, goodnutrition, and a clean environment. This led to a positive habit formation that protects themselvesand their loved ones. Truly, when viewed in a positive lens, this pandemic can bring out the best ofFilipinos.below, ider​</a>

                                            Let's Elaborate Read the excerpt below and do the activities that follow. What Are Filipinos Like (Excerpt)               Leon Ma. Guerrero Nothing is so difficult as self-appraisal, and to answer the question in the title of this article I thought it best to start by asking it. With no particular pattern in mind, 1 asked a number of foreign friends to give me their impression of the Filipino. I was told that we were friendly, good-natured, loyal, idealistic, sentimental, socially gracious ("even the lower classes"), unwilling to accept responsibility, lacking in self-reliance, less hardworking than the Chinese, more intelligent than the Malays, imitative but less so than the Japanese, religious but not so mystical as the Indians, and, in general, the most adaptable of all the races in the Orient. A Spaniard thought we were very like the Spanish; an American thought we were Dot American enough. A Frenchman remarked we were the only people in Asia with a sense of humor, at least the only ones who could laugh at themselves, which, when one thinks of it, was probably the prettiest compliment of all. By way of contrasts, our fellow Asians had a uniform tendency to laugh at us. A Siamese said we were pretentious. An Indonesian, in much the same yein, deplored our tendency to accept western standards at their face value. A Chinese thought we were zonpresident. An Indian was shocked by the cheapness in which human life was held by a people that could kill for a few centavos, a political argument, or a girl's ruffled feelings. The history of the Philippines might well be read in these national characteristics. There is, to start with, a relatively simple explanation for our notorious lack of self-reliance, which seem to be the main burden of compliment against us these days. For mor than four centuries of colonial rule, we were not allowed to rely on ourselves. Colonialism also suggests the reason for a certain unwillingness to accept responsibility, for too long in our history, it was not accompanied by any real authority.Reflect: How is the Filipino described in the text? What qualities did you like? What about the qualities that you did not  like?All in all, it would not be too far from the truth to say that we owe our faults to others, but our virtues are our own. Colonialism, through its various interpreters, made us irresponsible and imitative, improvident, and even "indolent." It gave us false ideas of the indignity of manual labor and the security of government job. It made us indifferent to our responsibilities to ourselves. Reflect: What assurance does the author give in the last part? If the Filipinos have some negative traits and attitudes, to whom shall these be attributed?​</a>

                                            * Lahat ng bansa sa sinaunang panahon ay umaasa sa agricultural economy. Masasabi natin na ang kanilang konseptong pang- ekonomiks ay napaka payak at simple sapagkat tinutugunan lamang nila ang kanilang pangangailangan para mabuhay sa pamamagitan ng hunting at gathering. . Sa agricultural economy karaniwang umaasa lamang ang tao sa mga yaman na available sa kalikasan lalong lalo na ung mga hilaw na materyal. Masasabi natin na walang malalim at kumplikadong application ng science particular ng chemistry. **Ang konteksto ng tao ay unti- unting nagbago nang ang populasyon sa bawat pamilya, tribu, komunidad, bansa at nasyon ay patuloy sa pagdami. Ito ay may kaakibat na implikasyon sa pinagkukunang yaman. Dahil dito, di maiiwasan ang mga digmaan. Kaya naman ang mga tao palaging nasa bingit ng kamatayan. Ito ang dahilan kung saan mas pinili nilang magpasailalim sa pang-aalipin kapalit ng proteksyon na maaring ipagkaloob ng mga naghaharing uri. Ngunit di lang basta ordinaryong pang-aalipin ang naging kapalit. nang mga naghaharing uri. Ang mga naghaharing-uri ay lumakas at naging makapangyarihan. Ang sitwasyong ito ay humatong sa pagkontrol sa buhay ng tao sapagkat naging konteksto nila ang "Yes, Amen, I do". Ang Pilipino ay di rin nakaligtas sa ganitong patterns sa kasaysayan na kung saan umabot ng 333 na taun na pang-aalipin. Sa kabila nito, unti-unti namang namulat ang tao kasama ang mga Pilipino, na kalaunan ay nagtuloy-tuloy sa pakikibaka (struggle), na may dakilang layunin na makalaya sa tanikala ng pang-aalipin. ***Sa pagkawala sa tanikala ng pang-aalipin, yumabong damdaming makabayan. Sa pagkakataong ito, lumawak ang pagtangkilik sa mga produktong atin na sa kasaysayan ay tanyag sa taguri na "Filipinization/indiginization. Ang mungkahing ito ay kalaunan sinuportahan ng gobyerno lalong lalo na sa administrasyon ng dating pangulo na si Carlos P. Garcia na kung saan isinulong niya ang Filipino First Policy.

                            5. What is Itq &amp;particularFolk songs in general have the following characteristicsA. The lyrics are according to the native tongue.Because songs are based on the daily experiences of the peoplein aplace and the message of the songs needs to be understood easily to be appreciated,the lyrics of the songs are written or sung in their own dialects. For example, theTagalog folk songs came from the people who speak Tagalog (Bahay Kubo, Leron,Leron Sinta, Magtanim ay Di Biro). The Ilocanos have their own (Manang Biday andSarung Banggi are just a few among the folk songs of Luzon that are sung in theirPamulinawen). The Kapampangan's Atin Cu Pung Singsing, and the Bicolano'sown dialects. Why do you think it is important for a folk song to be sung or writtenin their native tongue?B.

Viruses refer to infectious microscopic organisms that multiply only in living cells ofanimals, plants, or bacteria. They replicate themselves by integrating into the cell. When thishappens, the virus uses the cell's chemical machinery to keep itself alive. Viruses are responsible forcausing many diseases such as measles, chicken pox, common colds, SARS, and COVID-19. Inconclusion, viruses are microorganisms that harm other living things.7. It is definitely frightful to be infected with COVID-19. Though a large number ofpatients experience mild symptoms, turning it to a severe condition is still a possibility. I could notimagine a patient to experience chest pain, loss of speech or movement, and difficulty in breathingWhat is worse is the patient is all alone when he or she experiences all these struggles. Furthermore,anxiety and self-pity add to the struggle of the patients. Therefore, in order to avoid such conditions,let us not put our guards down from COVID-198. Cooking spaghert is very simple. First, cook pasta according to the instructpackaging. When pasta is cooked, drain it and set aside. Second, sauté garlic and onion in butterThird, add ground beef and cook for 5 minutes. Next, add hotdog and cook for 2 minutadd tomato sauce, banana ketchup, and a small amount of water to make a spaghetti sauce Simmerfor 20 minutes until cooked. Then, pour spaghetti sauce over paste. Finally, top with grated cheeseand serve. These are the easy steps to cook spaghetti.9. Crocodiles and alligators are different species. They don't belong to the samebiological family. Crocodiles came from the family of Crocodilia while alligators came from the familyof Alligatoridae. In terms of their habitat, crocodiles prefer to live in saltwater while alligators live infreshwater like rivers and lakes. The main reason for this geographical separation is that Crocodileshave well-developed salt glands on their tongue that expel large amounts of sait, enabling them tolive in more salty waters. However, alligators' salt glands don't function well, leading them to stick tofreshwater habitats. Another way to differentiate the two is by looking at the shape of their snoutsCracodiles have long pointed V shaped snouts while alligators have rounded U-shaped snouts. Thesefeatures make crocodiles and alligators distinct from each other.10. Despite the problems brought by the pandemic, it has undeniably cultivated certainFilipino values. Because of the situation, family ties have been strengthened. Filipinos have valuedmore the presence of the family members and enjoy the time together. Also, the crisis made theirfaith to God stronger. Further, they have better realized the importance of proper hygiene, goodnutrition, and a clean environment. This led to a positive habit formation that protects themselvesand their loved ones. Truly, when viewed in a positive lens, this pandemic can bring out the best ofFilipinos.below, ider​</h2><br />

                            9. Let's Elaborate Read the excerpt below and do the activities that follow. What Are Filipinos Like (Excerpt)               Leon Ma. Guerrero Nothing is so difficult as self-appraisal, and to answer the question in the title of this article I thought it best to start by asking it. With no particular pattern in mind, 1 asked a number of foreign friends to give me their impression of the Filipino. I was told that we were friendly, good-natured, loyal, idealistic, sentimental, socially gracious ("even the lower classes"), unwilling to accept responsibility, lacking in self-reliance, less hardworking than the Chinese, more intelligent than the Malays, imitative but less so than the Japanese, religious but not so mystical as the Indians, and, in general, the most adaptable of all the races in the Orient. A Spaniard thought we were very like the Spanish; an American thought we were Dot American enough. A Frenchman remarked we were the only people in Asia with a sense of humor, at least the only ones who could laugh at themselves, which, when one thinks of it, was probably the prettiest compliment of all. By way of contrasts, our fellow Asians had a uniform tendency to laugh at us. A Siamese said we were pretentious. An Indonesian, in much the same yein, deplored our tendency to accept western standards at their face value. A Chinese thought we were zonpresident. An Indian was shocked by the cheapness in which human life was held by a people that could kill for a few centavos, a political argument, or a girl's ruffled feelings. The history of the Philippines might well be read in these national characteristics. There is, to start with, a relatively simple explanation for our notorious lack of self-reliance, which seem to be the main burden of compliment against us these days. For mor than four centuries of colonial rule, we were not allowed to rely on ourselves. Colonialism also suggests the reason for a certain unwillingness to accept responsibility, for too long in our history, it was not accompanied by any real authority.Reflect: How is the Filipino described in the text? What qualities did you like? What about the qualities that you did not  like?All in all, it would not be too far from the truth to say that we owe our faults to others, but our virtues are our own. Colonialism, through its various interpreters, made us irresponsible and imitative, improvident, and even "indolent." It gave us false ideas of the indignity of manual labor and the security of government job. It made us indifferent to our responsibilities to ourselves. Reflect: What assurance does the author give in the last part? If the Filipinos have some negative traits and attitudes, to whom shall these be attributed?​</h2><br />

                            10. * Lahat ng bansa sa sinaunang panahon ay umaasa sa agricultural economy. Masasabi natin na ang kanilang konseptong pang- ekonomiks ay napaka payak at simple sapagkat tinutugunan lamang nila ang kanilang pangangailangan para mabuhay sa pamamagitan ng hunting at gathering. . Sa agricultural economy karaniwang umaasa lamang ang tao sa mga yaman na available sa kalikasan lalong lalo na ung mga hilaw na materyal. Masasabi natin na walang malalim at kumplikadong application ng science particular ng chemistry. **Ang konteksto ng tao ay unti- unting nagbago nang ang populasyon sa bawat pamilya, tribu, komunidad, bansa at nasyon ay patuloy sa pagdami. Ito ay may kaakibat na implikasyon sa pinagkukunang yaman. Dahil dito, di maiiwasan ang mga digmaan. Kaya naman ang mga tao palaging nasa bingit ng kamatayan. Ito ang dahilan kung saan mas pinili nilang magpasailalim sa pang-aalipin kapalit ng proteksyon na maaring ipagkaloob ng mga naghaharing uri. Ngunit di lang basta ordinaryong pang-aalipin ang naging kapalit. nang mga naghaharing uri. Ang mga naghaharing-uri ay lumakas at naging makapangyarihan. Ang sitwasyong ito ay humatong sa pagkontrol sa buhay ng tao sapagkat naging konteksto nila ang "Yes, Amen, I do". Ang Pilipino ay di rin nakaligtas sa ganitong patterns sa kasaysayan na kung saan umabot ng 333 na taun na pang-aalipin. Sa kabila nito, unti-unti namang namulat ang tao kasama ang mga Pilipino, na kalaunan ay nagtuloy-tuloy sa pakikibaka (struggle), na may dakilang layunin na makalaya sa tanikala ng pang-aalipin. ***Sa pagkawala sa tanikala ng pang-aalipin, yumabong damdaming makabayan. Sa pagkakataong ito, lumawak ang pagtangkilik sa mga produktong atin na sa kasaysayan ay tanyag sa taguri na "Filipinization/indiginization. Ang mungkahing ito ay kalaunan sinuportahan ng gobyerno lalong lalo na sa administrasyon ng dating pangulo na si Carlos P. Garcia na kung saan isinulong niya ang Filipino First Policy.
