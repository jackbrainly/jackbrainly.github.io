                                            Directions: Read on to find out why the Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras is considered to be a wonder of the world. Based on the information that you have learned from the selection, identify the paragraph that provides evidence as to why the Rice Terraces was proclaimed by UNESCO as a world heritage site, making it a world-renowned tourist destination. 
Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras – Outstanding Universal Value 
The Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras are an outstanding example of a developed, living cultural landscape. They can be traced as far as two millennia ago in the pre-colonial Philippines. They are found in the remote areas of the Philippines Cordillera mountain range on the northern island of Luzon, the Philippine archipelago. These historic terraces cover an extensive area. The property consists of five clusters of the most intact and impressive terraces located in four municipalities. They are all products of the Ifugao ethnic group, a minority community that has lived on these mountains for thousands of years. 
The five clusters are: (1) the Nagacadan terrace clusters in the municipality of Kiangan, in two distinctive rows of terraces divided by a river; (2) the Hungduan terrace cluster shaped like a spider web; (3) the central Mayoyao terrace cluster characterized by terraces in intervals with the traditional bale (houses) and alang (granaries); (4) the Bangaan terrace cluster in Banaue, the background of a typical Ifugao village; and (5) the Batad terrace cluster of Banaue that lies in semicircular terraces with a village at its base. 
The Ifugao Rice Terraces are an ideal example of a living cultural landscape of beauty beyond compare. 
The Ifugao Rice Terraces are valuable contributions of our ancestors to mankind. They were built 2, 000 years ago and passed on through generations and an example of an ancient civilization that overcame challenges passed by modernization. 
Built on steeper slopes of high mountains and the careful carving of the natural shapes of the hills, the Ifugao Rice Terraces have complex irrigation systems. Water comes from the forests of the mountain tops. 
The maintenance of the living rice terraces shows that the whole community works as one. It is based on the knowledge of the rich variety of biological resources which exist in the Ifugao agri-ecosystem.

Gemmalyn is raising her three young children in perhaps the most horrendous and difficult housing conditions imaginable – they live in a rundown pigpen with eight adult pigs and 10 other people. The pigsty is in the middle of a squalid shantytown in one of the poorest sections of Metro Manila. Gemmalyn has three children: 7-year-old Mark Daniel, 4-year-old Denmark and 2-year-old Regine. All her kids display indications of respiratory disease with their persistent coughing and chronic flu-like symptoms. Her youngest child, Regine, has always had colds since she was born. None of them has ever seen a doctor. Not even when they were born. Regine was in fact born in the pigpen they call home. The Philippines has an estimated 1.5 million homeless children. According to UNICEF, up to 250,000 of those are considered street children. The sprawling metropolis of Manila continues to have the highest concentration of homeless children in the entire country. The situation here is even worse than in war-torn provinces and disaster-ravaged regions. Overall, there remains a severe lack of systematic and comprehensive strategy to address the situation and protect the young.

                                            Directions: Read on to find out why the Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras is considered to be a wonder of the world. Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras – Outstanding Universal Value a The Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras are an outstanding example of a developed, living cultural landscape. They can be traced as far as two millennia ago in the precolonial Philippines. They are found in the remote areas of the Philippines Cordillera mountain range on the northern island of Luzon, Philippine archipelago. These historic terraces cover an extensive area. The property consists of five clusters of the most intact and impressive terraces located in four municipalities. They are all products of the Ifugao ethnic group, a minority community that has lived on these mountains for thousands of years. The five clusters are: (1) the Nagacadan terrace clusters in the municipality of Kiangan, in two distinctive rows of terraces divided by a river; (2) the Hungduan terrace cluster shaped like a spider web; (3) the central Mayoyao terrace cluster characterized by terraces in intervals with the traditional bale (houses) and alang (granaries); (4) the Bangaan terrace cluster in Banaue, the background of a typical Ifugao village; and (5) the Batad terrace cluster of Banaue that lies in semicircular terraces with a village at its base. The Ifugao Rice Terraces are an ideal example of a living cultural landscape of beauty beyond compare. The Ifugao Rice Terraces are valuable contributions of our ancestors to mankind. They were built 2,000 years ago and passed on through generations and an example of an ancient civilization that overcame challenges passed by modernization. Built on steeper slopes of high mountains and the careful carving of the natural shapes of the hills, the Ifugao Rice Terraces have complex irrigation systems. Water comes from the forests of the mountain tops.​</a>

                            5. Directions: Read on to find out why the Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras is considered to be a wonder of the world. Based on the information that you have learned from the selection, identify the paragraph that provides evidence as to why the Rice Terraces was proclaimed by UNESCO as a world heritage site, making it a world-renowned tourist destination. 
Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras – Outstanding Universal Value 
The Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras are an outstanding example of a developed, living cultural landscape. They can be traced as far as two millennia ago in the pre-colonial Philippines. They are found in the remote areas of the Philippines Cordillera mountain range on the northern island of Luzon, the Philippine archipelago. These historic terraces cover an extensive area. The property consists of five clusters of the most intact and impressive terraces located in four municipalities. They are all products of the Ifugao ethnic group, a minority community that has lived on these mountains for thousands of years. 
The five clusters are: (1) the Nagacadan terrace clusters in the municipality of Kiangan, in two distinctive rows of terraces divided by a river; (2) the Hungduan terrace cluster shaped like a spider web; (3) the central Mayoyao terrace cluster characterized by terraces in intervals with the traditional bale (houses) and alang (granaries); (4) the Bangaan terrace cluster in Banaue, the background of a typical Ifugao village; and (5) the Batad terrace cluster of Banaue that lies in semicircular terraces with a village at its base. 
The Ifugao Rice Terraces are an ideal example of a living cultural landscape of beauty beyond compare. 
The Ifugao Rice Terraces are valuable contributions of our ancestors to mankind. They were built 2, 000 years ago and passed on through generations and an example of an ancient civilization that overcame challenges passed by modernization. 
Built on steeper slopes of high mountains and the careful carving of the natural shapes of the hills, the Ifugao Rice Terraces have complex irrigation systems. Water comes from the forests of the mountain tops. 
The maintenance of the living rice terraces shows that the whole community works as one. It is based on the knowledge of the rich variety of biological resources which exist in the Ifugao agri-ecosystem.

Gemmalyn is raising her three young children in perhaps the most horrendous and difficult housing conditions imaginable – they live in a rundown pigpen with eight adult pigs and 10 other people. The pigsty is in the middle of a squalid shantytown in one of the poorest sections of Metro Manila. Gemmalyn has three children: 7-year-old Mark Daniel, 4-year-old Denmark and 2-year-old Regine. All her kids display indications of respiratory disease with their persistent coughing and chronic flu-like symptoms. Her youngest child, Regine, has always had colds since she was born. None of them has ever seen a doctor. Not even when they were born. Regine was in fact born in the pigpen they call home. The Philippines has an estimated 1.5 million homeless children. According to UNICEF, up to 250,000 of those are considered street children. The sprawling metropolis of Manila continues to have the highest concentration of homeless children in the entire country. The situation here is even worse than in war-torn provinces and disaster-ravaged regions. Overall, there remains a severe lack of systematic and comprehensive strategy to address the situation and protect the young. Instead of providing humane shelter and assistance, unlawful arrests and detentions of homeless children are still commonplace. GMA Public Affairs. "Front Row: Bata sa Babuyan." YouTube video, 16:12.

                            16. Directions: Read on to find out why the Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras is considered to be a wonder of the world. Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras – Outstanding Universal Value a The Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras are an outstanding example of a developed, living cultural landscape. They can be traced as far as two millennia ago in the precolonial Philippines. They are found in the remote areas of the Philippines Cordillera mountain range on the northern island of Luzon, Philippine archipelago. These historic terraces cover an extensive area. The property consists of five clusters of the most intact and impressive terraces located in four municipalities. They are all products of the Ifugao ethnic group, a minority community that has lived on these mountains for thousands of years. The five clusters are: (1) the Nagacadan terrace clusters in the municipality of Kiangan, in two distinctive rows of terraces divided by a river; (2) the Hungduan terrace cluster shaped like a spider web; (3) the central Mayoyao terrace cluster characterized by terraces in intervals with the traditional bale (houses) and alang (granaries); (4) the Bangaan terrace cluster in Banaue, the background of a typical Ifugao village; and (5) the Batad terrace cluster of Banaue that lies in semicircular terraces with a village at its base. The Ifugao Rice Terraces are an ideal example of a living cultural landscape of beauty beyond compare. The Ifugao Rice Terraces are valuable contributions of our ancestors to mankind. They were built 2,000 years ago and passed on through generations and an example of an ancient civilization that overcame challenges passed by modernization. Built on steeper slopes of high mountains and the careful carving of the natural shapes of the hills, the Ifugao Rice Terraces have complex irrigation systems. Water comes from the forests of the mountain tops.​</h2><br />
