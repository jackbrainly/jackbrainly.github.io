Brieflydescribe its (a) recency, (b) objectivity, (c) relevance and (d) conciseness. Do it onyour notebook.Review of Related Literature on Language and its Sustainabilityin the Teaching and Learning Process (Excerpt)Eugene Ray F Santos, MATWith the major premise to bring higher literacy among younger children,learners are being taught using their mother-tongue in their primary educationalongside with "Tagalog" which is the most common variety of the nationallanguage of the country. This is in consonance with the findings of variousstudies on bilingualism. McCabe et al., (2013) found a reasonable basis from thegrowing population of bilinguals in the world to affirm that learning using twolanguages does not lead to confusion or difficulty in an academic environment.The mentioned studies zoom in the starting phase of languagedevelopment wherein most factors that affect language learning are externallyproduced or the physical language environment. It can be pointed out that thesituation where a learner is raised and the people who surround him havebearing in the failure or success of language acquisition, training, and learning.Considering these factors beyond the school, the actual teaching-learningenvironment, language teachers indeed have a very serious job to work out.It is undeniable that there is voluminous input available about languageteaching and learning. However, making language learning effective and efficient,considering learners' diversity, personality, behavior, intelligence and otherequally important factorsfactors still remains quite challenging for languageprofessionalsPIVOT 4A CALABARZON23​</a>

                                             pa tagalog plsss Japanese management once attracted global attention It was very difficult for Westerners to understand why employees work so hard for a company. Many observers concluded that Japan must have had some magical 1 t 3 management system. But they were wrong. The Japanese work force has been rooted in a tradition that values diligence. The reason some Japanese enterprises excel is that their employees share this set of values and work hard for the company. In the next decade the new generation, which grew up in more affluent times, will form the majority in the work force, and individualism will come to the forefront. The decline of Japanese companies could thus begin if excessive individualism leads their people to lose 2 appreciation for the value of work. In the United States today, companies like Hewlett-Packard and IBM, which advocates corporate ideals and philosophy, continue to prosper. No company should rely solely on employees' native diligence or traditional values to succeed. We must set forth a company philosophy for our young employees, share with them the real meaning of work, and give them a purpose in life.​</a>

Having the desire from a sublime mind rather than by an ill intention will lead a higher possibility of victory. Thus, whatever it is that you desire with your sublime and pure mind for the cooperate management to be, it will certainly prevail and succeed. There are self-centered people who only care about themselves. Even those greedy and egoistic individuals can achieve their goal. An ardent desire becomes reality whether the intensions are upright or selfish. However, if the desire arises from greed and self-interest, the same desire which brought success initially will cause to fall through in the end.​</a>

                                            A plethora of terms has come to be associated with modern-day public relations practice. Because of the disreputable beginnings of public relations that we will briefly discuss next, it is often the case that organizations will choose to name their public relations function by another moniker. These various terms create much confusion about the responsibilities of public relations versus overlapping or competing organizational functions. The term corporate communication is the most common synonym for public relations in practice today, Bowen et al. (2006). followed by marketing communication and public affairs. We view the term corporate communication as a synonym for public relations, although some scholars argue that corporate communication only applies to for-profit organizations. However, we view corporate communication as a goal-oriented communication process that can be applied not only in the business world but also in the world of nonprofits and nongovernmental organizations, educational foundations, activist groups, faith-based organizations, and so on. The term public relations often leads to confusion between the media relations function, public affairs, corporate communication, and marketing promotions, leading many organizations to prefer the term corporate communication.  baka may alam mag Tagalog neto​</a>

There are many examples of secular music that became part of the cultural identities of the Philippines, especially in the place where it originated. However, these songs were influenced by Spanish music style because of the Spanish those music which resulted to its new style and unique cultural value. Let us take a look on harana and colonization in the Philippines. Since artistry is innate among Filipinos, we created our own version of balitaw. Spanish Tango or Habanera. Harana is a Filipino tradition of serenading a woman which derives its rhythmic style from the Harana Balitaw sung in triple meter. This secular music originated in the Visayas region, although some tagalog version Balitaw is an extemporaneous exchange of verses between a man and a woman and usually of balitaw music can also be found in some parts of the central and southern tagalog regions. A woman may express her message in the final stanzas of the song if she willfully accepts a man's suit or proposal for her. Both performers dance while singing. Tagalog versions of balitaw sometimes describe nature, places, or things figuratively but the inner message will also lead in love and courtship, pictures?

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Brain death is not the same as coma, because someone in a coma is unconscious but still alive. Brain death occurs when a critically ill patient dies sometime after being placed on life support. This situation can occur after, for example, a heart attack or stroke</p><p>coma is a state of unconsciousness where a person is unresponsive and cannot be woken. It can result from injury to the brain, such as a severe head injury or stroke. A coma can also be caused by severe alcohol poisoning or a brain infection (encephalitis).</p><p>Coma</p><p>A coma is a deep state of eyes-closed unconsciousness where a person is not able to respond to people or the environment around them. In a coma, a patient is alive and there is some brain activity. Depending on the severity of the injury, recovery time varies and comas can be temporary or permanent.</p><p></p><p>Patients in a coma might have brain stem responses, spontaneous breathing and/or non-purposeful motor responses. Coma has three possible outcomes: progression to brain death, recovery of consciousness, or evolution to a state of chronically depressed consciousness, such as a vegetative state.</p><p></p><p>Patients in comas are not considered for organ, eye, or tissue donation.</p><p></p><p>Brain Death</p><p>Brain Death is death. No brain function exists. Brain death results from swelling in the brain; blood flow in the brain ceases and without blood to oxygenate the cells, the tissue dies. It is irreversible. Once brain tissue dies, there is nothing that can be done to heal it.</p><p></p><p>The brain performs many functions, including thought, movement and all the neurological functions that allow the body to maintain blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, hormones, breathing, etc. When a person deteriorates to brain death, the body’s entire system stops. You cannot breathe, your heart cannot beat and your body cannot function once your brain dies. Massive artificial medical measures must be started to maintain organ function (such as ventilated support), but these interventions are only a temporary measure</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Sa medisina ang coma (mula sa Greek κῶμα, koma, nangangahulugang mahimbing na pagtulog) ay isang kalagayan ng walang-kamalayan ng mahigit sa 6 na oras; kung saan ang isang tao ay hindi magising at hindi makapagreak sa mga nangyayari sa kaniyang paligid gaya ng istimulasyong pisikal, paningin o pandinig</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

This is in consonance with the findings of variousstudies on bilingualism. McCabe et al., (2013) found a reasonable basis from thegrowing population of bilinguals in the world to affirm that learning using twolanguages does not lead to confusion or difficulty in an academic environment.The mentioned studies zoom in the starting phase of languagedevelopment wherein most factors that affect language learning are externallyproduced or the physical language environment. It can be pointed out that thesituation where a learner is raised and the people who surround him havebearing in the failure or success of language acquisition, training, and learning.Considering these factors beyond the school, the actual teaching-learningenvironment, language teachers indeed have a very serious job to work out.It is undeniable that there is voluminous input available about languageteaching and learning.

                            15.  pa tagalog plsss Japanese management once attracted global attention It was very difficult for Westerners to understand why employees work so hard for a company. Many observers concluded that Japan must have had some magical 1 t 3 management system. But they were wrong. The Japanese work force has been rooted in a tradition that values diligence. The reason some Japanese enterprises excel is that their employees share this set of values and work hard for the company. In the next decade the new generation, which grew up in more affluent times, will form the majority in the work force, and individualism will come to the forefront. The decline of Japanese companies could thus begin if excessive individualism leads their people to lose 2 appreciation for the value of work. In the United States today, companies like Hewlett-Packard and IBM, which advocates corporate ideals and philosophy, continue to prosper. No company should rely solely on employees' native diligence or traditional values to succeed. We must set forth a company philosophy for our young employees, share with them the real meaning of work, and give them a purpose in life.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Ang pamamahala ng Hapon ay minsang nakaakit ng pandaigdigang atensyon Napakahirap para sa mga Kanluranin na maunawaan kung bakit ang mga empleyado ay nagtatrabaho nang husto para sa isang kumpanya. Napagpasyahan ng maraming tagamasid na ang Japan ay may ilang mahiwagang 1 t 3 na sistema ng pamamahala. Ngunit nagkamali sila. Nag-ugat ang Japanese work force sa isang tradisyon na pinahahalagahan ang kasipagan. Ang dahilan kung bakit napakahusay ng ilang negosyo sa Japan ay dahil ang kanilang mga empleyado ay nagbabahagi ng hanay ng mga halagang ito at nagsusumikap para sa kumpanya. Sa susunod na dekada, ang bagong henerasyon, na lumaki sa mas mayayamang panahon, ay bubuo ng karamihan sa lakas ng trabaho, at ang indibidwalismo ay mauuna. Ang pagbaba ng mga kumpanyang Hapones ay maaaring magsimula kung ang labis na indibidwalismo ay humantong sa kanilang mga tao na mawalan ng pagpapahalaga sa halaga ng trabaho. Sa Estados Unidos ngayon, ang mga kumpanyang tulad ng Hewlett-Packard at IBM, na nagtataguyod ng mga ideyal at pilosopiya ng korporasyon, ay patuloy na umuunlad. Walang kumpanyang dapat umasa lamang sa katutubong kasipagan o tradisyonal na pagpapahalaga ng mga empleyado upang magtagumpay. Dapat tayong magtakda ng pilosopiya ng kumpanya para sa ating mga kabataang empleyado, ibahagi sa kanila ang tunay na kahulugan ng trabaho, at bigyan sila ng layunin sa buhay.</p><br />

                            20. pa Tagalog po In every strong desire accompanied by hard work, there is triumph. Having the desire from a sublime mind rather than by an ill intention will lead a higher possibility of victory. Thus, whatever it is that you desire with your sublime and pure mind for the cooperate management to be, it will certainly prevail and succeed. There are self-centered people who only care about themselves. Even those greedy and egoistic individuals can achieve their goal. An ardent desire becomes reality whether the intensions are upright or selfish. However, if the desire arises from greed and self-interest, the same desire which brought success initially will cause to fall through in the end.​</h2><br />

                            22. A plethora of terms has come to be associated with modern-day public relations practice. Because of the disreputable beginnings of public relations that we will briefly discuss next, it is often the case that organizations will choose to name their public relations function by another moniker. These various terms create much confusion about the responsibilities of public relations versus overlapping or competing organizational functions. The term corporate communication is the most common synonym for public relations in practice today, Bowen et al. (2006). followed by marketing communication and public affairs. We view the term corporate communication as a synonym for public relations, although some scholars argue that corporate communication only applies to for-profit organizations. However, we view corporate communication as a goal-oriented communication process that can be applied not only in the business world but also in the world of nonprofits and nongovernmental organizations, educational foundations, activist groups, faith-based organizations, and so on. The term public relations often leads to confusion between the media relations function, public affairs, corporate communication, and marketing promotions, leading many organizations to prefer the term corporate communication.  baka may alam mag Tagalog neto​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Ang isang kalabisan ng mga termino ay naiugnay sa modernong-araw na kasanayan sa relasyon sa publiko. Dahil sa hindi magandang pagsisimula ng mga relasyon sa publiko na tatalakayin natin sa madaling sabi, kadalasang pipiliin ng mga organisasyon na pangalanan ang kanilang tungkulin sa relasyon sa publiko ng ibang moniker. Ang iba't ibang terminong ito ay lumilikha ng maraming kalituhan tungkol sa mga responsibilidad ng mga relasyon sa publiko kumpara sa magkakapatong o nakikipagkumpitensyang mga tungkulin ng organisasyon. Ang terminong corporate communication ay ang pinakakaraniwang kasingkahulugan para sa public relations sa praktika ngayon, Bowen et al. (2006). sinusundan ng komunikasyon sa marketing at pampublikong gawain. Tinitingnan namin ang terminong corporate communication bilang kasingkahulugan para sa public relations, bagama't ang ilang mga iskolar ay nangangatwiran na ang corporate communication ay nalalapat lamang sa mga for-profit na organisasyon. Gayunpaman, tinitingnan namin ang corporate communication bilang isang proseso ng komunikasyon na nakatuon sa layunin na maaaring ilapat hindi lamang sa mundo ng negosyo kundi pati na rin sa mundo ng mga nonprofit at non-governmental na organisasyon, educational foundations, aktibistang grupo, faith-based na organisasyon, at iba pa. Ang terminong public relations ay kadalasang humahantong sa kalituhan sa pagitan ng media relations function, public affairs, corporate communication, at marketing promotions, na humahantong sa maraming organisasyon na mas gusto ang terminong corporate communication.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Maraming termino ang nauugnay sa modernong pagpapraktis ng relasyon sa publiko. Dahil sa hindi magandang simula ng relasyon sa publiko na aalalahanin namin sa susunod, kadalasan ay pumapili ang mga organisasyon na itawag ang kanilang funksyon ng relasyon sa publiko sa ibang pangalan. Ang iba't ibang mga terminong ito ay nagdudulot ng kalituhan tungkol sa mga responsibilidad ng relasyon sa publiko versus mga overlapping o kumpetensyang funksyon sa organisasyon. Ang terminong "corporate communication" ang pinakakaraniwang katumbas ng relasyon sa publiko sa pagpapraktis ngayon, ayon kay Bowen et al. (2006), na sinusundan ng "marketing communication" at "public affairs". Tinatawag namin ang terminong "corporate communication" na katumbas ng relasyon sa publiko, bagaman may ilang mananaliksik na nagtutol na ang corporate communication ay sumasakop lamang sa mga organisasyon na may layunin sa kita. Gayunpaman, tinatawag namin ang corporate communication na isang proseso ng komunikasyon na may layunin na maaaring ilapat hindi lamang sa mundo ng negosyo kundi pati na rin sa mundo ng mga hindi nagkikitang organisasyon, educational foundations, aktibistang grupo, faith-based organizations, at iba pa. Ang terminong relasyon sa publiko ay nagdudulot ng kalituhan sa pagitan ng funksyon ng media relations, public affairs, corporate communication, at marketing promotions, na nag-udyok sa maraming organisasyon na mapili ang terminong corporate communication.</p><br />
