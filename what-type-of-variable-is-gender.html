regarding their top 5 highest paid employees (such as CEOs,
president, etc.) You have the following information on these
2,500 workers: demographics (gender, age, and education),
time in months at the company, and salary. Your research
question is whether gender makes a difference in salary. In
detail, explain what descriptive and inferential statistics you
would use to answer this question. Also specify the type of
variables that you are using in the analysis. You may provide
an outline of tables or graphs that you would use in your
analysis. Also, provide a discussion of the limitations and
strengths of the research design.</h2><br />
                        To answer the research question of whether gender makes a difference in salary for the top 5 highest paid employees of Fortune 500 companies, I would use both descriptive and inferential statistics.<br /><br />Descriptive Statistics:<br /><br />• I would begin by creating frequency tables for gender, age, education, time in months at the company, and salary. This would give me an overview of the distribution of these variables in the sample.<br /><br />•I would then create boxplots for salary grouped by gender. This would allow me to visualize any differences in salary between men and women.<br /><br />•I would also calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation of salary for men and women. This would give me a sense of the central tendency and spread of the data for each group.<br /><br />Inferential Statistics:<br /><br />•I would use a t-test to determine if there is a significant difference in salary between men and women. This would allow me to infer whether gender is a significant predictor of salary.<br /><br />• I would also use multiple linear regression analysis to control for potential confounding variables such as age, education, and time in months at the company. This would allow me to determine if gender remains a significant predictor of salary after accounting for these other factors.<br /><br />The type of variables that I would be using in the analysis are:<br /><br />• Gender (categorical)<br />• Age (numerical)<br />• Education (categorical)<br />• Time in months at the company (numerical)<br />• Salary (numerical)<br /><br />Outline of tables and graphs that I would<br />use in the analysis:<br /><br />• Frequency tables for gender, age, education, time in months at the company, and salary<br /><br />• Boxplots for salary grouped by gender<br /><br />•Mean, median, and standard deviation of salary for men and women<br /><br />• T-test results for difference in salary between men and women<br /><br />• Multiple linear regression results for gender, age, education, and time in months at the company as predictors of salary<br /><br />Limitations of the research design:<br /><br />• The sample is limited to only the top 5 highest paid employees of Fortune 500 companies, so the findings may not be generalizable to the entire population of workers in these companies.<br /><br />• The data may be affected by measurement errors, such as inaccurate self-reported education or salary.<br /><br />• The data may be affected by bias, such as a gender bias in the selection of top 5 highest paid employees.<br /><br />Strengths of the research design:<br /><br />• The sample is large, which increases the power of the statistical analyses.<br /><br />• The data is collected from a well-defined population, which increases the internal validity of the study.<br /><br />• The use of both descriptive and inferential statistics allows for a comprehensive analysis of the data.<br />
