                                            President Rodrigo Duterte has issued a proclamation formally declaring a state of public health emergency throughout the Philippines after the health department reported the first known local transmission of the new coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Duterte signed Proclamation 922 on March 8 to “capacitate government agencies and LGUs (local government units) to immediately act to prevent loss of life, utilize appropriate resources to implement urgent and critical measures to contain or prevent the spread of Covid-19, mitigate its effects and impact to the community, and prevent serious disruption of the functioning of the government and the community.” The proclamation would also facilitate the implementation of mandatory reporting, intensify government response and measures, and enforce quarantine and disease control prevention measures. State of Public Health Emergency Declared in PH by Azer Parrocha President Rodrigo Duterte has issued a proclamation formally declaring a state of public health emergency throughout the Philippines after the health department reported the first known local transmission of the new coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Duterte signed Proclamation 922 on March 8 to “capacitate government agencies and LGUs (local government units) to immediately act to prevent loss of life, utilize appropriate resources to implement urgent and critical measures to contain or prevent the spread of Covid-19, mitigate its effects and impact to the community, and prevent serious disruption of the functioning of the government and the community.” The proclamation would also facilitate the implementation of mandatory reporting, intensify government response and measures, and enforce quarantine and disease control prevention measures. Duterte recognizes that the outbreak of Covid-19 constitutes an emergency that threatens national security which requires a “whole-of-government" response aligned with the Department of Health's (DOH) four-door framework for Covid-19, and the efforts of all concerned government agencies and LGUs. Under the proclamation, all government agencies and LGUs are tasked to give full assistance and cooperation and mobilize the necessary resources to undertake critical, urgent and appropriate response and measures in a timely manner to curtail and eliminate the Covid-19 threat. Health Secretary Francisco Duque III may seek the help of the Philippine National Police (PNP) and other law enforcement agencies to provide assistance in addressing the Covid-19 threat, the proclamation read. All citizens, residents, tourists, and establishment owners are urged to comply with these directives to prevent the transmission of Covid-19. The state of public health emergency will remain in force and effect until lifted by Duterte. Earlier, Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo said Duterte will be releasing an executive order to strengthen public health response versus Covid-19. However, he clarified in a radio interview that instead of an executive order, Duterte will be issuing a proclamation. There are 10 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the country and 41 patients under investigation (PUI) who are currently admitted to hospitals. Of these confirmed cases, the first known local transmission of the virus is an elderly man who frequented an Islamic prayer hall at the Greenhills Mall. Some local governments and schools have called off classes to undergo disinfection protocols. In a Laging Handa press briefing in Malacañang, Duque said he respected the decision of local governments but stressed that he does not see a need to call for a lockdown in Metro Manila. As of March 8, 2020, there are a total of 105,586 cases of Covid-19 that has spread to 101 countries. DOH has placed the country under Covid-19 Alert System to Code Red sublevel 1 to prepare national and local governments and the country’s health care providers for possible increases in suspected and confirmed cases of the disease.

(the photo is the criteria) Philippines' latest response to the pandemic by Anna Malindog.Uy (27 September 2020) The COVID-19 pandemic has to a considerable degree exposed the Philippines to several vulnerabilities, which include the knock-on effect of the pandemic on the country's economy, weakness of the country's existing health care system and infrastructures, and threats to food security because of the fragile agriculture and food systems of the country. The Philippine government has recognized that if these limitations are not addressed and given attention, they could aggravate the already challenging situation of the country due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The government has responded and taken steps and interventions to mitigate the situation and the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak in the country. Some of the most important and recent initiatives by the Philippine government as part of its mitigation response to the pandemic include: (a) the establishment of the One Command Hospital Center (OCHC) launched last month (August 2020) as a referral system between private and public hospital, (b) the ramping-up of the country's testing capacity (c) the augmentation in the numbers of contract-tracers and intensified contract tracing efforts; (d) the scaling-up of local health care system capacity and infrastructure, (e) the recent passage into law of the Bayanihan Act 2; and (f) the latest directive of President Rodrigo Duterte to extend the "state of calamity" in the Philippines until 12 September 2021 to gwe the national and local governments time to marshal their resources to better address and defeat the pandemic.​</a>

                                            Joseph Williams was appointed CEO of Pharaoh’s Enterprises upon the death of his Jacob. The company went public under the leadership of Joseph and had to adapt to being open and transparent to outside investors. There were pressures from the shareholders to reduce costs and increase profits. In response, Joseph implemented cost- cutting measures including downsizing by means of enforcing early retirement of employees who he felt could not cope in the move to digitize the operations of the business. As expected, most of the employees were not happy and this affected the morale of their employees. Joseph sought the assistance of Nehemiah Daniels, the VP of HR. Nehemiah suggested a comprehensive program wherein it is not just the managers who would be evaluated based on achieving results but even the employees by means of demonstrating to their employees that their performance affects company results. This in turn will show to the shareholders that the company’s primary objective is to increase performance. 1. Do you agree with the proposal of Nehemiah Daniels? Explain your answer. 2. If you were an employee of Pharaoh’s Enterprises, how would you react to the new evaluation system that will measure your performance vis-à-vis predetermined outcomes or objectives. 3.

We were in a department store, and I was so excited to see such a huge place. Suddenly, I turned around to ask my mom something, but she was gone! I began crying and screaming at the top of my lungs. A salesclerk came up to me and dad came running toward me and ask if I was okay. She got on the public address system and notified the customers that a little boy with blue jeans and a red cap was lost. Two minutes later my mom and dad came running toward me. We all cried and hugged each other. I'll never forget that day as long as I live. Activity 1. Directions: Based on the sample narrative above, answer the following questions.

                                            DOH surveillance reporting system defines acute bloody diarrhea (ABD) as "a person with acute diarrhea with visible blood in the stool". Since the early 1900s, ABD was reported as dysentery in the Philippine Health Statistics annual publication until dysentery reporting was merged with diarrhea reporting in 1984. Dysentery is bloody diarrhea caused by any of the following common pathogens: Shigella dysenteriae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Clostridium difficile, shiga toxin-producing strains of Escherichia coli (STEC), Yersinia enterocolitica, and Entamoeba histolytica (amoebic dysentery). The mode of transmission is through ingestion of contaminated food or water. Pathogenesis involves bacterial production of toxins which destroy the mucosal epithelial cells leading to inflammation and bleeding. However, acute bloody diarrhea may also be non-infectious in origin. Other diseases that lead to ABD are drug-induced colitis, ischemic colitis, and antibiotic-associated colitis among others. Because the definition of ABD is broad and may have different causes, the number of food and waterborne-related ABD cases reported in the PHS and FHSIS from 2008 to 2017 is unknown. Morbidity case rates for acute bloody diarrhea have fluctuated over the last ten years with a significant spike in 2010 and a rapidly increasing trend from 2014 to 2016, until sudden decline in 2017. Limitations in the availability of peer-reviewed publications explaining the phenomenon suggest investment on researches and improved data utilization and analysis. inflammatory bowel disease, a Source: Department of Health 1.

                            11. President Rodrigo Duterte has issued a proclamation formally declaring a state of public health emergency throughout the Philippines after the health department reported the first known local transmission of the new coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Duterte signed Proclamation 922 on March 8 to “capacitate government agencies and LGUs (local government units) to immediately act to prevent loss of life, utilize appropriate resources to implement urgent and critical measures to contain or prevent the spread of Covid-19, mitigate its effects and impact to the community, and prevent serious disruption of the functioning of the government and the community.” The proclamation would also facilitate the implementation of mandatory reporting, intensify government response and measures, and enforce quarantine and disease control prevention measures. State of Public Health Emergency Declared in PH by Azer Parrocha President Rodrigo Duterte has issued a proclamation formally declaring a state of public health emergency throughout the Philippines after the health department reported the first known local transmission of the new coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Duterte signed Proclamation 922 on March 8 to “capacitate government agencies and LGUs (local government units) to immediately act to prevent loss of life, utilize appropriate resources to implement urgent and critical measures to contain or prevent the spread of Covid-19, mitigate its effects and impact to the community, and prevent serious disruption of the functioning of the government and the community.” The proclamation would also facilitate the implementation of mandatory reporting, intensify government response and measures, and enforce quarantine and disease control prevention measures. Duterte recognizes that the outbreak of Covid-19 constitutes an emergency that threatens national security which requires a “whole-of-government" response aligned with the Department of Health's (DOH) four-door framework for Covid-19, and the efforts of all concerned government agencies and LGUs. Under the proclamation, all government agencies and LGUs are tasked to give full assistance and cooperation and mobilize the necessary resources to undertake critical, urgent and appropriate response and measures in a timely manner to curtail and eliminate the Covid-19 threat. Health Secretary Francisco Duque III may seek the help of the Philippine National Police (PNP) and other law enforcement agencies to provide assistance in addressing the Covid-19 threat, the proclamation read. All citizens, residents, tourists, and establishment owners are urged to comply with these directives to prevent the transmission of Covid-19. The state of public health emergency will remain in force and effect until lifted by Duterte. Earlier, Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo said Duterte will be releasing an executive order to strengthen public health response versus Covid-19. However, he clarified in a radio interview that instead of an executive order, Duterte will be issuing a proclamation. There are 10 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the country and 41 patients under investigation (PUI) who are currently admitted to hospitals. Of these confirmed cases, the first known local transmission of the virus is an elderly man who frequented an Islamic prayer hall at the Greenhills Mall. Some local governments and schools have called off classes to undergo disinfection protocols. In a Laging Handa press briefing in Malacañang, Duque said he respected the decision of local governments but stressed that he does not see a need to call for a lockdown in Metro Manila. As of March 8, 2020, there are a total of 105,586 cases of Covid-19 that has spread to 101 countries. DOH has placed the country under Covid-19 Alert System to Code Red sublevel 1 to prepare national and local governments and the country’s health care providers for possible increases in suspected and confirmed cases of the disease.

(the photo is the criteria) Philippines' latest response to the pandemic by Anna Malindog.Uy (27 September 2020) The COVID-19 pandemic has to a considerable degree exposed the Philippines to several vulnerabilities, which include the knock-on effect of the pandemic on the country's economy, weakness of the country's existing health care system and infrastructures, and threats to food security because of the fragile agriculture and food systems of the country. The Philippine government has recognized that if these limitations are not addressed and given attention, they could aggravate the already challenging situation of the country due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The government has responded and taken steps and interventions to mitigate the situation and the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak in the country. Some of the most important and recent initiatives by the Philippine government as part of its mitigation response to the pandemic include: (a) the establishment of the One Command Hospital Center (OCHC) launched last month (August 2020) as a referral system between private and public hospital, (b) the ramping-up of the country's testing capacity (c) the augmentation in the numbers of contract-tracers and intensified contract tracing efforts; (d) the scaling-up of local health care system capacity and infrastructure, (e) the recent passage into law of the Bayanihan Act 2; and (f) the latest directive of President Rodrigo Duterte to extend the "state of calamity" in the Philippines until 12 September 2021 to gwe the national and local governments time to marshal their resources to better address and defeat the pandemic.​</h2><br />

Philippines' latest response to the pandemic
by Anna Malindog.Uy (27 September 2020)
The COVID-19 pandemic has to a considerable degree exposed the Philippines to several vulnerabilities, which include the knock-on effect of the pandemic on the country's economy, weakness of the country's existing health care system and infrastructures, and threats to food security because of the fragile agriculture and food systems of the country.
The Philippine government has recognized that if these limitations are not addressed and given attention, they could aggravate the already challenging situation of the country due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The government has responded and taken steps and interventions to mitigate the situation and the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak in the country.
Some of the most important and recent initiatives by the Philippine government as part of its mitigation response to the pandemic include: (a) the establishment of the One Command Hospital Center (OCHC) launched last month (August 2020) as a referral system between private and public hospital, (b) the ramping-up of the country's testing capacity (c) the augmentation in the numbers of contract-tracers and intensified contract tracing efforts; (d) the scaling-up of local health care system capacity and infrastructure, (e) the recent passage into law of the Bayanihan Act 2; and (f) the latest directive of President Rodrigo Duterte to extend the "state of calamity" in the Philippines until 12 September 2021 to gwe the national and local governments time to marshal their resources to better address and defeat the pandemic.​</h2><br />
                        OPINION ESSAY PARAGRAPH<p></p>Philippines' Latest Response to the Pandemic<p></p><p>In my opinion, the <strong>Philippine government's response</strong> to the COVID-19 pandemic has been effective in addressing the vulnerabilities exposed by the pandemic in the country's economy, healthcare system, and food security. The establishment of the <strong>One Command Hospital Center (OCHC)</strong>, for example, is a valuable initiative that will help to improve coordination between private and public hospitals, which is essential in addressing the pandemic. Additionally, the government's efforts to increase testing capacity and contract tracing are crucial in containing <strong>the spread of the virus</strong>.</p><p>Furthermore, the passage of the Bayanihan Act 2 into law demonstrates the government's commitment to <strong>providing support</strong> and resources to those affected by the pandemic. The extension of the "state of calamity" until September 2021 is also a wise move, as it gives the government more time to marshal its resources and better address the challenges posed by the pandemic.</p><p>Overall, the Philippine government's response to<strong> the COVID-19 </strong>pandemic appears to be <strong>well-planned</strong> and well-coordinated. While the pandemic has exposed <strong>significant vulnerabilities</strong> in the country, the government's initiatives have demonstrated its commitment to addressing these issues and mitigating the impact of the pandemic.</p><p></p><p><strong>Learn more about Opinion Paragraphs here:</strong></p><p><strong>https://brainly.ph/question/9172033</strong></p><p><strong>#SPJ2</strong></p><br />

                            20. Joseph Williams was appointed CEO of Pharaoh’s Enterprises upon the death of his Jacob. The company went public under the leadership of Joseph and had to adapt to being open and transparent to outside investors. There were pressures from the shareholders to reduce costs and increase profits. In response, Joseph implemented cost- cutting measures including downsizing by means of enforcing early retirement of employees who he felt could not cope in the move to digitize the operations of the business. As expected, most of the employees were not happy and this affected the morale of their employees. Joseph sought the assistance of Nehemiah Daniels, the VP of HR. Nehemiah suggested a comprehensive program wherein it is not just the managers who would be evaluated based on achieving results but even the employees by means of demonstrating to their employees that their performance affects company results. This in turn will show to the shareholders that the company’s primary objective is to increase performance. 1. Do you agree with the proposal of Nehemiah Daniels? Explain your answer. 2. If you were an employee of Pharaoh’s Enterprises, how would you react to the new evaluation system that will measure your performance vis-à-vis predetermined outcomes or objectives. 3. Who should be involved in developing employee outcomes/objectives? 4. How do you think the problem will be addressed using proper communication?​</h2><br />

We were in a department store, and I was so excited to see such a huge place. Suddenly, I turned around to ask my mom something, but she was gone! I began crying and screaming at the top of my lungs. A salesclerk came up to me and dad came running toward me and ask if I was okay. She got on the public address system and notified the customers that a little boy with blue jeans and a red cap was lost. Two minutes later my mom and dad came running toward me. We all cried and hugged each other. I'll never forget that day as long as I live. Activity 1. Directions: Based on the sample narrative above, answer the following questions.

                            23. DOH surveillance reporting system defines acute bloody diarrhea (ABD) as "a person with acute diarrhea with visible blood in the stool". Since the early 1900s, ABD was reported as dysentery in the Philippine Health Statistics annual publication until dysentery reporting was merged with diarrhea reporting in 1984. Dysentery is bloody diarrhea caused by any of the following common pathogens: Shigella dysenteriae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Clostridium difficile, shiga toxin-producing strains of Escherichia coli (STEC), Yersinia enterocolitica, and Entamoeba histolytica (amoebic dysentery). The mode of transmission is through ingestion of contaminated food or water. Pathogenesis involves bacterial production of toxins which destroy the mucosal epithelial cells leading to inflammation and bleeding. However, acute bloody diarrhea may also be non-infectious in origin. Other diseases that lead to ABD are drug-induced colitis, ischemic colitis, and antibiotic-associated colitis among others. Because the definition of ABD is broad and may have different causes, the number of food and waterborne-related ABD cases reported in the PHS and FHSIS from 2008 to 2017 is unknown. Morbidity case rates for acute bloody diarrhea have fluctuated over the last ten years with a significant spike in 2010 and a rapidly increasing trend from 2014 to 2016, until sudden decline in 2017. Limitations in the availability of peer-reviewed publications explaining the phenomenon suggest investment on researches and improved data utilization and analysis. inflammatory bowel disease, a Source: Department of Health 1. What information does the chart present? 2. Which year had the most number of acute bloody diarrhea cases? 3. Which year had the least number of acute bloody diarrhea cases? 4. What is the trend in the morbidity rate of the cases? Explain. 5. How do you think would these data help in addressing the issue on this particular food and water-borne disease? 11 PIVOT 4A CALABARZON English G8​</h2><br />
