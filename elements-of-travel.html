                            4. what elements help you in identifying what concept or idea is in the poem "traveling through the dark"? cite a line from the poem and explain​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:Humanity vs. Nature</strong></p><p><strong>“Traveling through the Dark” explores the conflict between humanity and the natural world, and specifically meditates on the destructive potential of technology. The doe was presumably killed in a hit-and-run, with the driver who struck her not even bothering to move her body. Through this incident, the poem highlights technology's devastating effect on nature, as well as humanity's seeming indifference toward its role in this violence and destruction.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>The doe’s death is the direct result of technology butting up against the natural world. She would have been spared her gruesome fate had society not intruded on her habitat in the first place by constructing this road. And when the speaker says, “It is usually best to roll them into the canyon,” readers sense that it’s extremely common to find dead animals like this. This implies how little human society seems to care about its impact on nature, seeing dead animals in the road as a mere inconvenience rather than a call to change its ways.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Although society has intruded upon the "wilderness"—the doe's home—the dead doe is the one that now seems out of place. The speaker’s decision to move her is based on the possibility that she'll block traffic and cause “more death”—human death, to be specific. This makes it seem as if the doe has encroached upon the human world when in reality it’s the other way around: people have interfered with nature, making it harder for animals like the doe to live in peace.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>The poem implies that humanity has prioritized technology and convenience over all else. In keeping with this mindset, the speaker at first seems rather emotionless while trying to remove the doe from the road, treating it like nothing more than a roadblock, a disruption to the smooth flow of society. But feeling the warmth of the fawn in the doe’s stomach is a reminder that she, too, was once a living being—a mother, no less—and this forces a reconsideration of the speaker’s own place in the world.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>The speaker suddenly feels "the wilderness" listening—watching, and perhaps judging, what's happening—and seems to briefly acknowledge that humanity is merely one small part of a much larger world. That the speaker still pushes the doe off the ledge might imply that it's too late for people to change their ways, but for a moment, at least, the poem pushes readers to reflect upon society’s destructive and careless imposition on nature.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            7. identify and explain the various elements of travel.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.       FUNDING/MONEY</p><p></p><p>Traveling can be a very expensive activity if one wants to splurge on the luxury kind of travel. However, it can also be affordable with the help of really good planning and understanding of your own personal preferences. I usually plan my travels months before. Not only does it make me very excited, but it also helps me budget my funds. I try to go to a place that I haven’t been to once a year. This means that I have to set aside a travel fund and decide where I want to go. Instead of asking for gifts for birthdays or Christmas, it would be a good idea to ask for donations for your travel funds. Part-time jobs are also available everywhere, the salary might be small, but with proper budgeting, they will all add up. Smart planning and preparation will really make traveling affordable for everyone.</p><p></p><p>2.       DESTINATIONS</p><p></p><p>Who wouldn’t want to stop working and travel everywhere? Sadly, that’s not possible for everyone, so I think that carefully planning the place that you want to go has to be a priority. I always think that I can still explore more places locally if my time is limited and have the same fun as when I go internationally. The first thing to do is to know my preference. Should it be a  nature-focused trip, beach destination, colder place or an adventure trip? After that, I look at local destinations that I haven’t been to.

                        <p>There are no definite elements in travel. However, there are
four elements of travel which are widely recognized. The four are the
following:</p>

<p> </p>

<p>1.   The
distance of the destination</p>

<p>2.   The length of
stay at the destination</p>

<p>3.   Residence
or point of origin of the travelers</p>

<p>4.   The purpose
of travel</p>

                            11. How to describe the four elements of travel</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Funding/Money</p><p>2. Destinations</p><p>3. Right Time and Seasons</p><p>4. Sense of Fun and Adventures</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The world is getting smaller in terms of how people nowadays can go to different places in a span of a day. Traveling is not a luxury anymore. It can be done by anyone with proper planning. As we become more connected, we get to know more about different places, and the more we know, the more we get the urge to explore. So what can be the elements we need to know to experience traveling?</p><p>1.       <strong>FUNDING/MONEY</strong></p><p>Traveling can be a very expensive activity if one wants to splurge on the luxury kind of travel. However, it can also be affordable with the help of really good planning and understanding of your own personal preferences. I usually plan my travels months before. Not only does it make me very excited, but it also helps me budget my funds. I try to go to a place that I haven’t been to once a year. This means that I have to set aside a travel fund and decide where I want to go. Instead of asking for gifts for birthdays or Christmas, it would be a good idea to ask for donations for your travel funds. Part-time jobs are also available everywhere, the salary might be small, but with proper budgeting, they will all add up. Smart planning and preparation will really make traveling affordable for everyone.</p><p>2.       <strong>DESTINATIONS</strong></p><p>Who wouldn’t want to stop working and travel everywhere? Sadly, that’s not possible for everyone, so I think that carefully planning the place that you want to go has to be a priority. I always think that I can still explore more places locally if my time is limited and have the same fun as when I go internationally. The first thing to do is to know my preference. Should it be a  nature-focused trip, beach destination, colder place or an adventure trip? After that, I look at local destinations that I haven’t been to. Most places around the country or to nearby ones offer most of the things that I want to do. I then decide by browsing through websites and look at the places where not that many people go. I like to explore those kinds of places and see what they have to offer. Also, make sure that you plan your itinerary well, be flexible and also don’t think that you can see everything.  It’s better actually see and experience a place rather than just hop on and off.</p><p>3.    <strong>   RIGHT TIME AND SEASON</strong></p><p>Peak tourist season means that hotels and flights will be more expensive.

                            30. Decribe the four element of travel​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Four basic elements have been used as criteria for defining travelers and/or tourists. These are: distance, length of stay at the destination, residence of the traveler and purpose of travel.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>1.       FUNDING/MONEY</p><p></p><p>Traveling can be a very expensive activity if one wants to splurge on the luxury kind of travel. However, it can also be affordable with the help of really good planning and understanding of your own personal preferences. I usually plan my travels months before. Not only does it make me very excited, but it also helps me budget my funds. I try to go to a place that I haven’t been to once a year. This means that I have to set aside a travel fund and decide where I want to go. Instead of asking for gifts for birthdays or Christmas, it would be a good idea to ask for donations for your travel funds. Part-time jobs are also available everywhere, the salary might be small, but with proper budgeting, they will all add up. Smart planning and preparation will really make traveling affordable for everyone.</p><p></p><p>2.       DESTINATIONS</p><p></p><p>Who wouldn’t want to stop working and travel everywhere? Sadly, that’s not possible for everyone, so I think that carefully planning the place that you want to go has to be a priority. I always think that I can still explore more places locally if my time is limited and have the same fun as when I go internationally. The first thing to do is to know my preference. Should it be a  nature-focused trip, beach destination, colder place or an adventure trip? After that, I look at local destinations that I haven’t been to. Most places around the country or to nearby ones offer most of the things that I want to do. I then decide by browsing through websites and look at the places where not that many people go. I like to explore those kinds of places and see what they have to offer. Also, make sure that you plan your itinerary well, be flexible and also don’t think that you can see everything.  It’s better actually see and experience a place rather than just hop on and off.</p><p></p><p>3.       RIGHT TIME AND SEASON</p><p></p><p>Peak tourist season means that hotels and flights will be more expensive. That’s why it’s important to first decide the destination and read up about the right season to travel there. If time is not on your side, it’s still possible to schedule your travel by going when it’s almost at the end of that season. I usually go when I get my holidays, however, with the help of my advanced planning, I am able to check when I can possibly get the best of what hotels and flights have to offer.</p><p></p><p>4.       SENSE OF FUN AND ADVENTURE</p><p></p><p>I can say that my best travel moments and destinations were when I went with locals. It might be a little bit scary but they really know where the best places to go. We usually go to restaurants with no tourists but full of locals. I found that a smile goes a long way and people usually respond to this, especially in Southeast Asia. Try to learn a few words of the local language and people will try to help you out more. They appreciate the effort and that goes a long way in meeting and enjoying yourself. </p><br />
