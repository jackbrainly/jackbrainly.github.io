                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>  Chores: Few of us enjoy doing them, but for a household to run smoothly these tedious and time-consuming tasks must get done. It’s a given that the adults will do their part around the house, but when it comes to assigning housework to children, there’s some debate.</p><p></p><p>Many parents want to preserve childhood for as long as possible, letting the “kids be kids” and enjoy plenty of playtime while they’re still young. Others may see children as less capable, preferring to finish the housework as quickly and efficiently as possible. These arguments make sense, but they also overlook the many positive benefits of giving kids chores.</p><p></p><p>Consider these seven reasons why children should help out around the house:</p><p></p><p>1. Chores help teach life skills. They’re young now, but they won’t be kids forever! Laundry, cooking and budgeting are just some of the skills your kids will need once they finally move out. These are also things that schools do not fully teach, making learning them at home even more important.</p><p></p><p>2. Chores help kids learn responsibility and self-reliance. Assigning children regular chores helps teach them responsibility. Tasks that personally affect your kids, such as cleaning their room or doing their own laundry, can help them become more self-reliant at the same time. Your kids or grandkids may also take pride in being considered mature enough to take care of themselves.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Hope it helps:)</p><br />
