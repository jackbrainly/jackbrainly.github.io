                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Health was earlier said to be the ability of the body functioning well. However, as time evolved, the definition of health also evolved. It cannot be stressed enough that health is the primary thing after which everything else follows. When you maintain good health, everything else falls into place. There is this stigma that surrounds mental health. People do not take mental illnesses seriously. To be completely fit, one must also be mentally fit. When people completely discredit mental illnesses, it creates a negative impact.</p><p></p><p>For instance, you never tell a person with cancer to get over it and that it’s all in their head in comparison to someone dealing with depression. Similarly, we should treat mental health the same as physical health.Parents always take care of their children’s physical needs. They feed them with nutritious foods and always dress up their wounds immediately. However, they fail to notice the deteriorating mental health of their child. Mostly so, because they do not give it that much importance. It is due to a lack of awareness amongst people.</p><p>Even amongst adults, you never know what a person is going through mentally.</p><p></p><p>Thus, we need to be able to recognize the signs of mental illnesses. A laughing person does not equal a happy person. We must not consider mental illnesses as a taboo and give it the attention it deserves to save people’s lives.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Corona virus pandemic is not just a medical crisis, but a social and economic one too, says ILO Director-General Guy Ryder. If our response is to be effective it must take into account all these factors, and be delivered in a co-ordinated, global way. In particular, it must answer the needs of the most vulnerable.</p><p></p><p>The human dimensions of the COVID-19 pandemic  reach far beyond the critical health response. All aspects of our future will be affected – economic, social and developmental. Our response must be urgent, coordinated and on a global scale, and should immediately deliver help to those most in need. </p><p>From workplaces, to enterprises, to national and global economies, getting this right is predicated on social dialogue between governments and those on the front line – the employers and workers.</p><p></p><p>This pandemic has mercilessly exposed the deep faultlines in our labour markets. Enterprises of all sizes have already stopped operations, cut working hours and laid off staff. Many are teetering on the brink of collapse as shops and restaurants close, flights and hotel bookings are cancelled, and businesses shift to remote working. Often the first to lose their jobs are those whose employment was already precarious - sales clerks, waiters, kitchen staff, baggage handlers and cleaners. </p><p></p><br />
