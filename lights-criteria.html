They can either be connected in series or parallel. A series circuit is a circuit in which two components share a common node and the same current flows through them. However, in a parallel circuit, components share two common nodes.

In such circuits, the current has only one path. Let us consider the household decorative string lights as an example of a series circuit. This is nothing but a series of multiple tiny bulbs connected in series. If one bulb fuses, all the bulbs in series do not light up.</p><p>What is a Parallel Circuit?</p><p>A circuit is said to be parallel when the electric current has multiple paths to flow through. The components that are a part of the parallel circuits will have a constant voltage across all ends.</p><p>Difference Between Series and Parallel Circuits</p><p>Difference Between Series and Parallel Circuits</p><p>The major difference between series and the parallel circuit is the amount of current that flows through each of the components in the circuit. In a series circuits, the same amount of current flows through all the components placed in it. On the other hand, in parallel circuits, the components are placed in parallel with each other due to this the circuit splits the current flow. The current flowing from the source will be divided into the current flowing through each of these components.</p><p>Difference Between Series and Parallel Circuits</p><p>Series Parallel</p><p>The same amount of current flows through all the components The current flowing through each component combines to form the current flow through the source.</p><p>In an electrical circuit, components are arranged in a line In an electrical circuit, components are arranged parallel to each other</p><p>When resistors are put in a series circuit, the voltage across each resistor is different even though the current flow is the same through all of them. When resistors are put in a parallel circuit, the voltage across each of the resistors is the same.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.Information can be thought of as the resolution of uncertainty; it answers the question of "What an entity is" and thus defines both its essence and the nature of its characteristics. The concept of information has different meanings in different contexts.[1] Thus the concept becomes related to notions of constraint, communication, control, data, form, education, knowledge, meaning, understanding, mental stimuli, pattern, perception, representation, and entropy.</p><p>2.In composition and speech, the organization is the arrangement of ideas, incidents, evidence, or details in a perceptible order in a paragraph, essay, or speech. It is also known as the elements' arrangement or dispositio, as in classical rhetoric.</p><p>3.Arts integration has been a mixed blessing, with both the potential for developing deeper understandings amid concerns that it diminishes the integrity and authenticity of learning in the arts. This article describes concept-based arts integration as a model of arts integration where curriculum is designed around shared concepts that connect across the arts and other academic subjects. The benefits of using concept-based arts integration curriculum are explored within the scope of an educational outreach program led by a professional symphony orchestra that partnered in a multiphase arts integrated program with forty surrounding elementary schools. Several strategies and criteria are included to help music educators identify shared concepts and design concept-based arts integrated projects in their schools.</p><p>4.output materials of unit u respectively and U denote set of all units in the biorefinery.
