Identify the different typesof welding materials by writing down the correct answer on the space provided.1. It is a metal that can also be welded readily when proper technique isused and adequate knowledge is applied.2. Two considerations needed in using this type of steel is choosing theproper grade for its purpose and knowing the strength of the materials.3. One reason for its excellent weldability is its more ductile than othertypes of steel because it has low amounts of carbon.4. This material is similar to aluminum, its element has much lowermelting point than oxides, making it critical to remove oxides before welding.5. To protect this material from oxidation, it requires full coverage from ashielding gas to provide a high level of weld integrity.11ing steel product Write your answer on the​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>FirewoodThe mechanical properties of wood include strength in tension and compression (as measured in axial and transverse directions), shear, cleavage, hardness, static bending, and shock (impact bending and toughness).Glass bottleThe main characteristics of glass bottle are transparency, heat resistance, pressure and breakage resistance and chemical resistance.CanThe cans intended to contain food must have the strength and robustness to allow handling, filling and processing, storage and distribution without damage. The most delicate moment of a container is during the sterilization process to which it is subjected once filled and closed.GasolineThe most important properties of gasoline fuels are properties such as volatility and knocking resistance, whereas diesel fuels are required to have important fuel properties such as viscosity, surface tension, and ignition tendency.Rubber BandElasticity: The molecular structure of rubber materials allows them to return to their normal shape after being compressed or stretched. This characteristic is apparent in rubber bands. Stretching or compressing a rubber band temporarily pulls or pushes the individual molecules out of alignment with each other.<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>pa brainliest po :)</p><p>thanks me later</p><p></p><br />

It is a metal that can also be welded readily when proper technique isused and adequate knowledge is applied.2. Two considerations needed in using this type of steel is choosing theproper grade for its purpose and knowing the strength of the materials.3. One reason for its excellent weldability is its more ductile than othertypes of steel because it has low amounts of carbon.4. This material is similar to aluminum, its element has much lowermelting point than oxides, making it critical to remove oxides before welding.5. To protect this material from oxidation, it requires full coverage from ashielding gas to provide a high level of weld integrity.11ing steel product Write your answer on the​</h2><br />
