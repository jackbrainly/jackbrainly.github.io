On June 15,1991, Mt. Pinatubo erupted, which was noted as the second most powerful eruption. It is located                           at                        Zambales,                          Philippines. 2. Mount Ruapehu in New Zealand is one of the more active volcanoes in the Ring of Fire, with yearly minor eruptions,                     and           major            eruptions                     occurring                about                every              50           years.3. Mount Fuji, Japan's tallest and most famous mountain, is an active volcano in the Ring of Fire. Mount Fuji last erupted in 1707, but recent earthquake activity in eastern Japan may have put the volcano in a "critical state."4. On 10 April 1815, Tambora produced the largest eruption known on the planet during the past 10,000 years.5. Mount St. Helens, in the U.S. state of Washington, is an active volcano in the Cascade Mountains. Its historic 1980 eruption lasted 9 hours and covered nearby areas in tons of volcanic ash.6. The Bogoslof island is the exposed summit of a volcano that sits in 6,000 feet of water in the Bering Sea about 40 miles west of the Alaskan island of Unalaska, which is part of the Aleutian chain. Bogoslof has had a series of eruptions over the several weeks in December 2016, spewing gases and ash into the skies and prompting aviation warnings.​</a>

Competency: Discuss how energy from the Sun interacts with the layers of the atmosphere. 
13. How does energy from the sun interact with the layers of the atmosphere? 
A. The sun’s energy enters the top of the atmosphere as shortwaves radiations and makes its way down to the ground without reacting with the greenhouse gases. As the long wave’s radiation goes up into the atmosphere, it is absorbed by greenhouse gases. 
B. Temperature differences in the atmosphere are a result of the way solar energy is absorbed as it moves through the atmosphere. 
C. Sunlight hits the earth most directly at and near the equator, the extra energy absorbed there to heat up the air, land, and water. The heat from land band water gets sent back up into the air heating it even more. D. All discussions are correct.

Historically, the total number of islands in they archipelago was held to be 7,107, but in 2016, the National Mapping and Resource Information Authority of the Philippines announced the discovery of more than 500 previously uncharted islands. The archipelago stretches about 1.150 miles ( 1,850 km) from the north to south and its widest east-west extent at its southern base is some 700 miles (1.130 km). The island of Taiwan lies north of the Batan Group, the Malaysian portion of the island of Borneo is to the south of Palawan, and the eastern island of Indonesia lies to the South and southeast of Mindanao. Only about two-fifths of the islands and islets have names and only some 350 have areas of 1 square mile (2.6 sq. km.) or more. List down the topic sentence and three supporting details.​</h2><br />

ACTIVITY: CONNECT THE DOTS Directions: Read each situation below and locate the places where each situation occurred by drawing a dot on the world map (ANNEX B) Then, connect all the dots you have drawn.1. On June 15,1991, Mt. Pinatubo erupted, which was noted as the second most powerful eruption. It is located                           at                        Zambales,                          Philippines. 2. Mount Ruapehu in New Zealand is one of the more active volcanoes in the Ring of Fire, with yearly minor eruptions,                     and           major            eruptions                     occurring                about                every              50           years.3. Mount Fuji, Japan's tallest and most famous mountain, is an active volcano in the Ring of Fire. Mount Fuji last erupted in 1707, but recent earthquake activity in eastern Japan may have put the volcano in a "critical state."4. On 10 April 1815, Tambora produced the largest eruption known on the planet during the past 10,000 years.5. Mount St. Helens, in the U.S. state of Washington, is an active volcano in the Cascade Mountains. Its historic 1980 eruption lasted 9 hours and covered nearby areas in tons of volcanic ash.6. The Bogoslof island is the exposed summit of a volcano that sits in 6,000 feet of water in the Bering Sea about 40 miles west of the Alaskan island of Unalaska, which is part of the Aleutian chain. Bogoslof has had a series of eruptions over the several weeks in December 2016, spewing gases and ash into the skies and prompting aviation warnings.​</h2><br />

13. How does energy from the sun interact with the layers of the atmosphere? 
A. The sun’s energy enters the top of the atmosphere as shortwaves radiations and makes its way down to the ground without reacting with the greenhouse gases. As the long wave’s radiation goes up into the atmosphere, it is absorbed by greenhouse gases. 
B. Temperature differences in the atmosphere are a result of the way solar energy is absorbed as it moves through the atmosphere. 
C. Sunlight hits the earth most directly at and near the equator, the extra energy absorbed there to heat up the air, land, and water. The heat from land band water gets sent back up into the air heating it even more. D. All discussions are correct.
