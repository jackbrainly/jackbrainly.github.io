(Tagalog)
Panganay na anak ni Haring Saul si Jonathan. Isa siyang matapang na mandirigma. Sinabi ni David na mas mabilis pa si Jonathan kaysa sa agila at mas malakas pa kaysa sa leon. Dahil si Jonathan ang panganay na anak ni Saul, siya dapat ang susunod na magiging hari ng Israel. Subalit batid niya na si David ang pinili ni Diyos na susunod na magiging hari. Imbes na mainggit, naging matalik na magkaibigan sina Jonathan at David. Nangako silang poprotektahan at ipagtatanggol nila ang isa’t isa. Ibinigay ni Jonathan kay David ang kaniyang damit, espada, pana, at sinturon bilang tanda o simbolo ng kanilang pagkakaibigan. Noong panahong tumatakas si David kay Saul, pinuntahan siya ni Jonathan at sinabing: ‘Huwag kang matakot. Ikaw ang pinili ni Diyos na maging hari, at batid ’yan ng aking ama.’ Ilang beses ding nanganib ang buhay ni Jonathan dahil sa pagtulong sa kanyang kaibigang si David. Alam niyang gustong patayin ni Haring Saul ang kanyang kaibigan, kaya kinausap niya ang kaniyang ama at sinabi: ‘Magkakasala ka kapag pinatay mo si David; wala naman siyang kasalanan sa iyo.’ Si Haring Saul ay nagalit kay Jonathan. Makalipas ang ilang taon, magkasamang namatay sa digmaan sina Haring Saul at Jonathan. Pumalit sa puwesto ng pagiging hari si David. Hinanap ni Haring David ang anak ni Jonathan na si Mepiboset. Nang magkita sila, sinabi ni David kay Mepiboset: ‘Matalik kong kaibigan ang iyong ama, kaya hindi kita pababayaan. Maninirahan ka sa palasyo ko at kakain sa mesa ko.’ Hindi nalimutan ni Haring David ang kanyag kaibigan at pinagpatuloy ang naging pangako kay Jonathan sa pamamagitan ng kanyang naging anak.
(English)
King Saul's eldest son Jonathan. He was a brave warrior. David said that Jonathan was even faster than the eagle and even stronger than the lion. Since Jonathan was Saul's firstborn son, he was to be the next king of Israel. But he knew that God had chosen David to be the next king. Instead of being jealous, Jonathan and David became close friends. They promised to protect and defend each other. Jonathan gave David his garment, sword, bow, and belt as a sign or symbol of their friendship. When David is fleeing from Saul, Jonathan comes to him and says: 'Do not be afraid. You are the one God has chosen to be king, and my father knows that. ’Jonathan’s life was also in danger several times for helping his friend David. He knew that King Saul wanted to kill his friend, so he spoke to his father and said: ‘You will sin if you kill David; he has not sinned against you. ’King Saul was angry with Jonathan. Some years later, King Saul and Jonathan died together in battle. David succeeds him as king. King David sought out Jonathan's son Mephibosheth. When they meet, David tells Mephibosheth: 'Your father is a close friend of mine, so I will not leave you. You will live in my palace and eat at my table. ’King David did not forget his handsome friend and continued the promise made to Jonathan through his son.

                            19. Jonathan at David
(Tagalog)
Panganay na anak ni Haring Saul si Jonathan. Isa siyang matapang na mandirigma. Sinabi ni David na mas mabilis pa si Jonathan kaysa sa agila at mas malakas pa kaysa sa leon. Dahil si Jonathan ang panganay na anak ni Saul, siya dapat ang susunod na magiging hari ng Israel. Subalit batid niya na si David ang pinili ni Diyos na susunod na magiging hari. Imbes na mainggit, naging matalik na magkaibigan sina Jonathan at David. Nangako silang poprotektahan at ipagtatanggol nila ang isa’t isa. Ibinigay ni Jonathan kay David ang kaniyang damit, espada, pana, at sinturon bilang tanda o simbolo ng kanilang pagkakaibigan. Noong panahong tumatakas si David kay Saul, pinuntahan siya ni Jonathan at sinabing: ‘Huwag kang matakot. Ikaw ang pinili ni Diyos na maging hari, at batid ’yan ng aking ama.’ Ilang beses ding nanganib ang buhay ni Jonathan dahil sa pagtulong sa kanyang kaibigang si David. Alam niyang gustong patayin ni Haring Saul ang kanyang kaibigan, kaya kinausap niya ang kaniyang ama at sinabi: ‘Magkakasala ka kapag pinatay mo si David; wala naman siyang kasalanan sa iyo.’ Si Haring Saul ay nagalit kay Jonathan. Makalipas ang ilang taon, magkasamang namatay sa digmaan sina Haring Saul at Jonathan. Pumalit sa puwesto ng pagiging hari si David. Hinanap ni Haring David ang anak ni Jonathan na si Mepiboset. Nang magkita sila, sinabi ni David kay Mepiboset: ‘Matalik kong kaibigan ang iyong ama, kaya hindi kita pababayaan. Maninirahan ka sa palasyo ko at kakain sa mesa ko.’ Hindi nalimutan ni Haring David ang kanyag kaibigan at pinagpatuloy ang naging pangako kay Jonathan sa pamamagitan ng kanyang naging anak.
(English)
King Saul's eldest son Jonathan. He was a brave warrior. David said that Jonathan was even faster than the eagle and even stronger than the lion. Since Jonathan was Saul's firstborn son, he was to be the next king of Israel. But he knew that God had chosen David to be the next king. Instead of being jealous, Jonathan and David became close friends. They promised to protect and defend each other. Jonathan gave David his garment, sword, bow, and belt as a sign or symbol of their friendship. When David is fleeing from Saul, Jonathan comes to him and says: 'Do not be afraid. You are the one God has chosen to be king, and my father knows that. ’Jonathan’s life was also in danger several times for helping his friend David. He knew that King Saul wanted to kill his friend, so he spoke to his father and said: ‘You will sin if you kill David; he has not sinned against you. ’King Saul was angry with Jonathan. Some years later, King Saul and Jonathan died together in battle. David succeeds him as king. King David sought out Jonathan's son Mephibosheth. When they meet, David tells Mephibosheth: 'Your father is a close friend of mine, so I will not leave you. You will live in my palace and eat at my table. ’King David did not forget his handsome friend and continued the promise made to Jonathan through his son.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Southeast Asia is a geographically expansive and populous region characterized by fascinating social and cultural variation. Particularly striking to the outside observer is the region’s ethnic and religious diversity. The majority of the countries in this region are home to dozens of different ethnic groups (and in some cases, hundreds), many with their own distinct languages, cultures, and styles of dress. Many of these groups have their own systems of religious belief and practice as well. Groups living in highland areas tend to follow religions involving animistic beliefs and practices, which are based on the idea that spiritual or supernatural powers organize and animate the natural world or material universe. In animistic traditions, plants, animals, and other natural phenomena (mountains, streams, etc.) are assumed to have souls or to be inhabited by spirits. In animistic societies, certain people are believed to have personal qualities or special skills that enable them to communicate with spirits. They may be shamans who go into trance if possessed by spirits, undertake mystical journeys to the world(s) inhabited by spirits, or both. Shamans are ritual specialists, this being an umbrella term that refers to people who specialize in ritual practices of one sort or another and thus includes spirit mediums (like Raseh, from the village of Mentu Tapuh in Sarawak, East Malaysia, who recounts the epic poem, “The Story of Kichapi”), diviners, magicians, sorcerers, witches, and priests.</p><p></p><br />
