On the vertical part of the cross, write the value you choose to deepen your relationship with God. Write the other value on the horizontal part to develop a healthy relationship with others. Explain each value on the lines provided. Draw you own cross inside the box.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>in my opinion</p><p>i will choose Love to develope my relationship to God and others because, love is the greatest act of all.  Even God, loved us unconditionally that He gave His begotten Son Jesus to die in thrme cross for our sins. </p><p>if you love God, you'll obey, fear and serve Him that will strengthen your relationship. Also if you love your neighbor,enemies like yourself, there will be no anger.  because you will focus on how to show them love uncinditionally. It not as easy as how you say it. But true love mentioned in the bible is the 'agape' love means unselfish love , unconditional love.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>sana makatulong</p><p>aral mabuti</p><p>pa brainliest kung meron</p><p></p><p><strong>T</strong><strong>O</strong><strong> </strong><strong>G</strong><strong>O</strong><strong>D</strong><strong> </strong><strong>B</strong><strong>E</strong><strong> </strong><strong>T</strong><strong>H</strong><strong>E</strong><strong> </strong><strong>G</strong><strong>L</strong><strong>O</strong><strong>R</strong><strong>Y</strong><strong>!</strong><strong>❤️</strong></p><br />
