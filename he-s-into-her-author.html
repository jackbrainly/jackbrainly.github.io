As a reader, you have to be suspicious and be cautious when the writer uses emotionallyloaded words, writes very harsh and abusive things about or against someone or somethingor maligns or insults another.21. Some writers present opposing issues or hints and these are what a critical reader or thinkermay use in his or her analysis of the text.22. The critical reader is able to get clues which will help him interpret the work, and understandthe how's and why's that made the author write the text.23. The critical thinker checks if the writer is building a common ground with the readers, or ifs/he is basing his or her reasoning on shared beliefs.24.

                                            3. PassageThe critics are wrong about Lily Evangelista’s first collection of short stories entitled Breaking the Shell. The varying writing styles used in each of the stories do not show that Evangelista has yet to find her own style as a writer; rather, it actually portrays her flexibility and ingenuity in choosing a style that would best fit the story she wants to tell. Many critics also disliked the use of colloquial language and deliberate wrong grammar in the dialogues in two of the stories in the collection. However, this actually makes thecharacters a lot more relatable, and it lends a certain uniqueness and freshness to the stories, making this collection a cut above the rest.QuestionWhich of the following persuasive techniques is used in the given excerpt of a critique?A. giving an exampleB. attacking an opposing viewC. defending an opposing viewD. using statistics4.

                            22. Last Monday, I was swinging from my favorite tree branch. I don't mean to brag, but I am an excellent tree swinger. The sky was a magnificent blue and there wasn't a cloud to be such. The air was filled with the wonderful aroma of spring What a perfect day to be outside. And so, there I was, swinging happily from the great oak tree, when suddenly, S-N-A-P! I experienced the sharpest pain I've ever felt. Right then and there, I realized I should have listened to my father's advice. He warned me that the branch couldnt support me. The branch cracked in two. And so did the bone in my arm when I hit the ground. I let out an earsplitting scream and my mother came running. The pain was unbearable! When we arrived at the emergency room, the doctor set my arm and sent us on our way. My arm doesn't hurt anymore, but it itches the cast. Next time, 111 listen to the words of wisdom.

                            23. Rodrigo Duterte is the Best President in the World. No one can beat his record as the best and strongest President in the world of all time. His genuine leadership is most admired and loved of the majority Filipino people specially the masses. On April 20, 2017, he ranked as the most influential leader in the world according to the online worldwide survey of Time Magazine. It is because of his effective and genuine leadership specially how he implemented effectively on War on Drugs, Fighting Corruptions and Poverty, implementing big projects such as boosting our infrastructure under the Build! Build! Build! Project called the “GOLDEN ERA OF THE PHILIPPINE INFRASTRUCTURE” and many more! In just a year, there are more achievements under his leadership even if you combine the three decades of the past presidents in from Corazon Aquizon to her son Benigno Aquino. He is unmatched in his achievements in the recorded history of the Republic of the Philippines.QUESTIONS 1 What does the author say about President Duterte? 2 Is the author for or against President Duterte? Why do you say so? 3. Is the author biased in what s/he said / wrote? If yes, give at least three examples of biased statements. (If your answer no, go to Question #5.)4. Why do your say these statements are biased? (If you answered this, no need to answer Questions #5). 5. If you answered NO in number 3, why do you say that the author is not biased? ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Author says that the current president of the Republic of the Philippines is the best and gives several reasons why.</p><p>2. The author is in favor of the current president as the text was heavily in favor of the president.</p><p>3 and 4. The author is biased. First of all, the second and third sentences are an opinion, not a fact. The fourth sentence is false, there is no such thing as "Most Influential Leader" by Time Magazine. There is no proof of the effectiveness of War on Drugs, corruption is still heavily prevalent, and we arent in the Golden Era of the Philippine Infrastructure because of the Build Build Build Project - We arent even in a Golden Era. Lastly, the last two sentences are obviously opinions, and in fact are false - you can research about this easily with credible sources.</p><p></p><br />
