                                            Describe the message of Pope Francis in his homily:We have a high priest who is capable of symphatizing with our weaknesses but one who is similarly been tested in every way yet without sin. Jesus is like us. Jesus lived like us. Jesus is the same with us in every respect except sin. Because Jesus was not a sinner.But to be more like us, He assumed our condition and our sin. He made himself unto sin. This is what Saint Paul tells us. Jesus always goes before us. And when we pass and experience a cross, He passed there before us.And if today we find ourselves 14 months after, 14 months precisely after the typhoon Yolanda hit, it is because we have the security of knowing that we are not going to weaken in our faith, because Jesus has been there before us. In His passion, He assumed all our pain.I’d like to tell you something close to my heart.When I saw from Rome the catastrophe, I felt that I had to be here and on those very days I decided to come here.I am here to be with you. A little bit late, I have to say, but I am here.I come to tell you that Jesus is Lord and He never lets us down.Father, you might say to me, I was let down because I have lost so many things, my house, my livelihood. It’s true, if you would say that, and I respect those sentiments, but Jesus there (pointing to the cross), nailed to the cross, and from there, He does not let us down.He was consecrated as Lord, on that throne and there He experienced all calamities that we experienced. Jesus is Lord and the Lord from the cross is there for you.Therefore, He is capable of understanding us, as we heard in the first reading. In everything, the same as us.That is why we have a Lord who is capable of crying with us, capable of walking with us, in the most difficult moments of life.So many of you have lost everything. I don’t know what to say to you. But the Lord does know what to say to you. Some of you have lost part of your families. All I can do is keep silent. And I walk with you all with my silent heart. Many of you have asked the Lord, why Lord?And to each of you, to your heart, Christ responds from His heart upon the cross.I have no more words to tell you, let us look to Christ, He is the Lord. He understands us because He underwent all the trials that we, that you, have experienced. And beside the cross was His mother. We are like this little child, just there.In the moments when we have so much pain, when we no longer understand anything, all we can do is grab hold of her hand firmly. And say, Mom, as a child does to a mother, when he or she feels fear.It is perhaps the only word we can say in such difficult times, Mother, Mom.Let us together hold a moment of silence, let us look to that Christ on the cross. He understands us because He endured everything. Let us look to our mother, and like that little child, let us grab hold of her mantle, and with a true heart, say, mother.In silence, let us say this prayer, say it to the mother, what you feel in your heart.(silence)Let us know that we have Mother Mary and our great brother Jesus, we are not alone. We also have many brothers who in this moment of catastrophe came to help you, and we too, because of this we feel more brothers and sisters, because we helped each other.This is what comes from my heart and forgive me if I have no other words to express this: But please know, Jesus never lets you down. Please know that the love and tenderness of Mother Mary never lets you down.And holding on to her mantle and with the power that comes from Jesus love on the cross, let us move forward, always forward, and walk together as brothers and sisters in the Lord forward.Thank you very much.​</a>

 Count Your Blessings

What are some of the blessings we receive from because of our faith in Jesus Christ?
One of the greatest blessings is answers to our prayers.
When Jim was a little boy, he loved to ride his horse. He had a pair of spurs that made him feel like a cowboy. One day when he came in from riding, he was disobedient and his mother sent him to his room in the basement. He was so angry that he threw his spurs down the stairs. Later he repented and told his mother that he was sorry. The next time he wanted to ride his horse, he couldn’t find the spurs. He looked everywhere. Finally he knelt and prayed to Heavenly Father to help him find them. When he finished praying he started looking again and found them.
This was the beginning of Jim’s testimony that Heavenly Father hears and answers prayers. Now he is a stake president. He teaches the children in his stake that praying every night and morning will bring them great blessings all the rest of their lives.
Praying sincerely to Heavenly Father morning and night makes it easier to hear the still, small voice of the Holy Ghost, the Comforter and Jesus Christ promised to all who keep His commandments. The Holy Ghost can teach us, guide us and help us feel peace in our hearts. These blessings come when we have faith in Jesus Christ.
Sometimes we need strength because life is hard for us. Christy wanted to memorize the articles of faith and earn her Gospel in Action award. It was extra hard for her because she has cerebral palsy. Christy had faith that the Lord would help her. She listened to the song tapes of the Articles of Faith over and over. She practiced until she could sing them all and earned her award. Her family and friends were blessed by her good example. When we count our blessings we can say, “My prayers are answered, I receive guidance and comfort, I can receive strength to overcome trials.” Yes, faith in Jesus Christ blesses our lives.</a>

                                            A Prayer for Your Enemies
Lord Jesus, following Your example and command, we pray for our enemies today. We ask first that You would saturate our lives with the Holy Spirit’s power and might. Send Your love flowing through us, and forgive us for holding on to anything that could hinder our prayers. We release any unforgiveness, thoughts of revenge, or hateful emotions that can quench Your Spirit in our hearts. Then give us wisdom as we seek how to bless, to love, and to pray for our enemies.
We pray for you to bless our enemies and to orchestrate events in their lives that will leave their hearts exposed before you. As You characterized blessing in the Beatitudes, we pray that You would give them a poverty of spirit that recognizes their deep need for You. We pray they will discover Your comfort in times of mourning, and they would be humbled before You—in Your way and Your time. We pray You would show them mercy before it is too late—knowing we were all God’s enemies before You extended mercy to us—and that they would, in turn, be merciful to others.
Lord, we pray that instead of lusting for pure evil, they would hunger and thirst for Your purity and righteousness, become advocates of Your justice and that their warring spirits would be changed into peacemaking. Remove the façade of well-being; tear down the lies that have deceived them; and hedge their ways until they can see no way out but up. We pray You would show them the futility of what they are doing because in opposing God’s kingdom and in their darkness, they are often oblivious about the true reasons for their behavior and resulting consequences. Reveal to them any deep hurts or traumas in their own lives that may be contributing to their destructive actions.
Knowing how you sometimes use pain and difficulty to bring blessing to our lives, we pray the same for our enemies. Use whatever means You need to soften stony hearts, open blind eyes, and to help them realize their ultimate neediness for You. If necessary, allow persecution in their own lives so they can experience Your blessing. Speak to them in miraculous, supernatural ways if necessary, through a dream, a movie, another believer, Your Word—or even through our own lives if we are ever confronted. In some way, let them witness Your power and recognize that You are the source. We pray for conviction, for an honest evaluation of their own destiny, and for a sense of desperation if that’s what it takes for them to consider Your claims and to discover Who You really are. Pursue them, even allowing goodness to lead them to repentance. And give us patience and a deep trust in You, Lord, even when we can’t see any change in our enemies. When we waver, not wanting to pray for our enemies, help us to remember Your grace in our own lives, and what we would be without You.
 Amen

A big crowd had gathered to see him, including a man named Zacchaeus who worked as a tax collector. He was short and didn't have many friends. In fact, most people hated him. Tax collectors gathered money from the people to give to the government. Some of them were dishonest and took more money than they were supposed to and kept the extra coins for themselves. Zacchaeus wasn’t honest. He got very rich from other people’s money.But then Zacchaeus met Jesus. He was curious about who he was and climbed a tree to see Jesus over the crowds (he was very short). As Jesus came by, he stopped right under the tree where Zacchaeus was waiting. Jesus looked up at Zacchaeus and told him to come down because he wanted to have a visit with him at his house!Zacchaeus eagerly took Jesus home with him. He felt God’s love and forgiveness for all his dishonesty in the past. Meeting Jesus changed his heart. He wanted to make things right! He promised to give 4 x more than he took and shared his wealth with the poor. He became a follower of Jesus and lived his life with honesty in both his words and actions.Discussion Questions1. Who was Zacchaeus?2. Why didn’t people like him?3. How did Jesus treat Zacchaeus?4. How did Zacchaeus change after meeting Jesus?5. Why is honesty important in our relationships with other people?​</a>

What do we mean when we say we believe?" Is it always about evidences? Most of us adhere to the
saying exist but we
believe sise. We know that air is real although we do not see it. Then there is love and faith. Saying the
believe is an affirmation that we have faith. But what is faith? It is a personal decision and involves the voluele
prayer and worship person. It includes the head or knowledge of God, the hands or our actions, and the heart expressed in our
That is why Jesus, in the Gospel, said to Thomas, "Happy are those who believe even without seeing
evidence. Continuing to believe makes a person convinced and certain of his or her faith and that's what
makes a Christian fortunate and happy. We believe not so much because there are convincing evidences
presented to us but because we trust God, the Giver of faith, whom we know does not and cannot be
deceived.
Similarly, it does not mean that faith is "blind acceptance. So then, faith involves believing, doing, and
prayerful trusting. It is not just knowing God but it is expressing that knowledge in our actions, and that same
knowledge will serve as our "security blanket" in whatever we do and whatever we go through. Faith that is
lived and celebrated in worship is a force within us that, by the power of the Holy Spirit, gradually works a
transformation in our daily thoughts, hopes, attitudes, and values.

                            4. Describe the message of Pope Francis in his homily:We have a high priest who is capable of symphatizing with our weaknesses but one who is similarly been tested in every way yet without sin. Jesus is like us. Jesus lived like us. Jesus is the same with us in every respect except sin. Because Jesus was not a sinner.But to be more like us, He assumed our condition and our sin. He made himself unto sin. This is what Saint Paul tells us. Jesus always goes before us. And when we pass and experience a cross, He passed there before us.And if today we find ourselves 14 months after, 14 months precisely after the typhoon Yolanda hit, it is because we have the security of knowing that we are not going to weaken in our faith, because Jesus has been there before us. In His passion, He assumed all our pain.I’d like to tell you something close to my heart.When I saw from Rome the catastrophe, I felt that I had to be here and on those very days I decided to come here.I am here to be with you. A little bit late, I have to say, but I am here.I come to tell you that Jesus is Lord and He never lets us down.Father, you might say to me, I was let down because I have lost so many things, my house, my livelihood. It’s true, if you would say that, and I respect those sentiments, but Jesus there (pointing to the cross), nailed to the cross, and from there, He does not let us down.He was consecrated as Lord, on that throne and there He experienced all calamities that we experienced. Jesus is Lord and the Lord from the cross is there for you.Therefore, He is capable of understanding us, as we heard in the first reading. In everything, the same as us.That is why we have a Lord who is capable of crying with us, capable of walking with us, in the most difficult moments of life.So many of you have lost everything. I don’t know what to say to you. But the Lord does know what to say to you. Some of you have lost part of your families. All I can do is keep silent. And I walk with you all with my silent heart. Many of you have asked the Lord, why Lord?And to each of you, to your heart, Christ responds from His heart upon the cross.I have no more words to tell you, let us look to Christ, He is the Lord. He understands us because He underwent all the trials that we, that you, have experienced. And beside the cross was His mother. We are like this little child, just there.In the moments when we have so much pain, when we no longer understand anything, all we can do is grab hold of her hand firmly. And say, Mom, as a child does to a mother, when he or she feels fear.It is perhaps the only word we can say in such difficult times, Mother, Mom.Let us together hold a moment of silence, let us look to that Christ on the cross. He understands us because He endured everything. Let us look to our mother, and like that little child, let us grab hold of her mantle, and with a true heart, say, mother.In silence, let us say this prayer, say it to the mother, what you feel in your heart.(silence)Let us know that we have Mother Mary and our great brother Jesus, we are not alone. We also have many brothers who in this moment of catastrophe came to help you, and we too, because of this we feel more brothers and sisters, because we helped each other.This is what comes from my heart and forgive me if I have no other words to express this: But please know, Jesus never lets you down. Please know that the love and tenderness of Mother Mary never lets you down.And holding on to her mantle and with the power that comes from Jesus love on the cross, let us move forward, always forward, and walk together as brothers and sisters in the Lord forward.Thank you very much.​</h2><br />

Much of what he learned leading sheep he applied as a leader of men. Famously, he appealed to his exploits in guarding the flock, how he depended upon God, to illustrate his ability to fight Goliath (1 Sam. 17:34–37).

What are some of the blessings we receive from because of our faith in Jesus Christ?
One of the greatest blessings is answers to our prayers.
When Jim was a little boy, he loved to ride his horse. He had a pair of spurs that made him feel like a cowboy. One day when he came in from riding, he was disobedient and his mother sent him to his room in the basement. He was so angry that he threw his spurs down the stairs. Later he repented and told his mother that he was sorry. The next time he wanted to ride his horse, he couldn’t find the spurs. He looked everywhere. Finally he knelt and prayed to Heavenly Father to help him find them. When he finished praying he started looking again and found them.
This was the beginning of Jim’s testimony that Heavenly Father hears and answers prayers. Now he is a stake president. He teaches the children in his stake that praying every night and morning will bring them great blessings all the rest of their lives.
Praying sincerely to Heavenly Father morning and night makes it easier to hear the still, small voice of the Holy Ghost, the Comforter and Jesus Christ promised to all who keep His commandments. The Holy Ghost can teach us, guide us and help us feel peace in our hearts. These blessings come when we have faith in Jesus Christ.
Sometimes we need strength because life is hard for us. Christy wanted to memorize the articles of faith and earn her Gospel in Action award. It was extra hard for her because she has cerebral palsy. Christy had faith that the Lord would help her. She listened to the song tapes of the Articles of Faith over and over. She practiced until she could sing them all and earned her award. Her family and friends were blessed by her good example. When we count our blessings we can say, “My prayers are answered, I receive guidance and comfort, I can receive strength to overcome trials.” Yes, faith in Jesus Christ blesses our lives.</h2><br />

                            18. A Prayer for Your Enemies
Lord Jesus, following Your example and command, we pray for our enemies today. We ask first that You would saturate our lives with the Holy Spirit’s power and might. Send Your love flowing through us, and forgive us for holding on to anything that could hinder our prayers. We release any unforgiveness, thoughts of revenge, or hateful emotions that can quench Your Spirit in our hearts. Then give us wisdom as we seek how to bless, to love, and to pray for our enemies.
We pray for you to bless our enemies and to orchestrate events in their lives that will leave their hearts exposed before you. As You characterized blessing in the Beatitudes, we pray that You would give them a poverty of spirit that recognizes their deep need for You. We pray they will discover Your comfort in times of mourning, and they would be humbled before You—in Your way and Your time. We pray You would show them mercy before it is too late—knowing we were all God’s enemies before You extended mercy to us—and that they would, in turn, be merciful to others.
Lord, we pray that instead of lusting for pure evil, they would hunger and thirst for Your purity and righteousness, become advocates of Your justice and that their warring spirits would be changed into peacemaking. Remove the façade of well-being; tear down the lies that have deceived them; and hedge their ways until they can see no way out but up. We pray You would show them the futility of what they are doing because in opposing God’s kingdom and in their darkness, they are often oblivious about the true reasons for their behavior and resulting consequences. Reveal to them any deep hurts or traumas in their own lives that may be contributing to their destructive actions.
Knowing how you sometimes use pain and difficulty to bring blessing to our lives, we pray the same for our enemies. Use whatever means You need to soften stony hearts, open blind eyes, and to help them realize their ultimate neediness for You. If necessary, allow persecution in their own lives so they can experience Your blessing. Speak to them in miraculous, supernatural ways if necessary, through a dream, a movie, another believer, Your Word—or even through our own lives if we are ever confronted. In some way, let them witness Your power and recognize that You are the source. We pray for conviction, for an honest evaluation of their own destiny, and for a sense of desperation if that’s what it takes for them to consider Your claims and to discover Who You really are. Pursue them, even allowing goodness to lead them to repentance. And give us patience and a deep trust in You, Lord, even when we can’t see any change in our enemies. When we waver, not wanting to pray for our enemies, help us to remember Your grace in our own lives, and what we would be without You.
 Amen

A big crowd had gathered to see him, including a man named Zacchaeus who worked as a tax collector. He was short and didn't have many friends. In fact, most people hated him. Tax collectors gathered money from the people to give to the government. Some of them were dishonest and took more money than they were supposed to and kept the extra coins for themselves. Zacchaeus wasn’t honest. He got very rich from other people’s money.But then Zacchaeus met Jesus. He was curious about who he was and climbed a tree to see Jesus over the crowds (he was very short). As Jesus came by, he stopped right under the tree where Zacchaeus was waiting. Jesus looked up at Zacchaeus and told him to come down because he wanted to have a visit with him at his house!Zacchaeus eagerly took Jesus home with him. He felt God’s love and forgiveness for all his dishonesty in the past. Meeting Jesus changed his heart. He wanted to make things right! He promised to give 4 x more than he took and shared his wealth with the poor. He became a follower of Jesus and lived his life with honesty in both his words and actions.Discussion Questions1.

He is known primarily for his faith in climbing a sycamore tree to see Jesus, and also his generosity in giving half of all he possessed. A descendant of Abraham, he was an example of Jesus's personal, earthly mission to bring salvation to the lost.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>2</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>Zacchaeus was a tax collector who lived in Jericho. Many people hated Zacchaeus, not only because he was rich and powerful, but also because they thought that he was a sinner because of his job. Zacchaeus heard that Jesus was coming to visit Jericho, and wanted to see him.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>3</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>Jesus looked up and said, “Hurry down, Zacchaeus, because I must stay in your house today.” The people started grumbling because Jesus was going to the home of a sinner. However, Zacchaeus promised to give half his belongings to the poor and pay back four times as much to anyone he had cheated.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>4</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>Zacchaeus showed he was willing to change by offering half of his belongings to the poor and paying back four times as much to anyone he had cheated. This amount was what the Old Testament law demanded as a repayment for dishonesty.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>5</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>Honesty is the foundation for trust in a relationship, and trust is necessary for a relationship to function and thrive. When you're always honest with someone, it tells them that they can trust you and the things you say.

                            27. YOU HAVE A MESSAGE 1
What do we mean when we say we believe?" Is it always about evidences? Most of us adhere to the
saying exist but we
believe sise. We know that air is real although we do not see it. Then there is love and faith. Saying the
believe is an affirmation that we have faith. But what is faith? It is a personal decision and involves the voluele
prayer and worship person. It includes the head or knowledge of God, the hands or our actions, and the heart expressed in our
That is why Jesus, in the Gospel, said to Thomas, "Happy are those who believe even without seeing
evidence. Continuing to believe makes a person convinced and certain of his or her faith and that's what
makes a Christian fortunate and happy. We believe not so much because there are convincing evidences
presented to us but because we trust God, the Giver of faith, whom we know does not and cannot be
deceived.
Similarly, it does not mean that faith is "blind acceptance. So then, faith involves believing, doing, and
prayerful trusting. It is not just knowing God but it is expressing that knowledge in our actions, and that same
knowledge will serve as our "security blanket" in whatever we do and whatever we go through. Faith that is
lived and celebrated in worship is a force within us that, by the power of the Holy Spirit, gradually works a
transformation in our daily thoughts, hopes, attitudes, and values.
