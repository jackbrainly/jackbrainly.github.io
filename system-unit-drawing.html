Ancient Greek architectural drawings also lacked a sense of depth or perspective 4. The Industrial Revolution (1760-1850) was a period during which many technological advances were developed 5. This was known as the scientific cut-away' view. This form of schematic involved presenting a twodimensional side elevation view of an object that had been drawn as if sliced cleanly in half down the canter. 6. In today's technology driven business environment, most mechanical drawing is done by computer. 7. Programs which preform mechanical drawing functions include AutoCAD, micro station, CorelDraw, Vector works or Adobe Illustrator 8. Technical drawing, drafting or drawing, is the act and discipline of composing drawings that visually communicate how something functions or is constructed 9. Technical drawing is essential for communicating ideas in industry and engineering, to make the drawings easier to understand, people use familiar symbols, perspectives, units of measurement, notation systems, visual styles, and page layout 10.A sketch is a quickly executed, freehand drawing that is usually not intended as a finished work.​</a>

                                            What is Difference between Free Hand Drawing and Technical Drawing.Answer.○ Freehand drawing is the ability to draw something without depending on instruments or something else to draw. We guide the drawing process with only our hand, and it depends on our observational skills. Instead of tracing the likeness of a cat, or using instruments to do it for us, we draw it by hand. While. ○ Technical drawing, drafting (Drawing), is the act and discipline of composing drawings that visually communicate how something functions or is constructed.Technical drawing is essential for communicating ideas in industry and engineering. To make the drawings easier to understand, people use familiar symbols, perspectives, units of measurement, notation systems, visual styles, and page layout. Together, such conventions constitute a visual language and help to ensure that the drawing is unambiguous and relatively easy to understand. Many of the symbols and principles of technical drawing are codified in an international standard called ISO 128.(c) Wikepedia​</a>

                            28. What is Difference between Free Hand Drawing and Technical Drawing.Answer.○ Freehand drawing is the ability to draw something without depending on instruments or something else to draw. We guide the drawing process with only our hand, and it depends on our observational skills. Instead of tracing the likeness of a cat, or using instruments to do it for us, we draw it by hand. While. ○ Technical drawing, drafting (Drawing), is the act and discipline of composing drawings that visually communicate how something functions or is constructed.Technical drawing is essential for communicating ideas in industry and engineering. To make the drawings easier to understand, people use familiar symbols, perspectives, units of measurement, notation systems, visual styles, and page layout. Together, such conventions constitute a visual language and help to ensure that the drawing is unambiguous and relatively easy to understand. Many of the symbols and principles of technical drawing are codified in an international standard called ISO 128.(c) Wikepedia​</h2><br />
