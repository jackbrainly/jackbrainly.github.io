                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Everybody deserves to have enough information about aids. Since we already know that aids is one of the problem in our country. It is better to conduct it with families especially those with young adults and teenagers sons and daughters. This can be a form of health education so that the parents can guide also their children. They can also help them in taking care of themselves. Since we all know that millennials are once who are really in need of guidance. With this aids awareness seminar, we can somehow lessen the increase of positive cases and let us educate the young about its effect to our health. </p><p></p><p></p><p>#BRAINLYEVERYDAY</p><br />

                        <p> </p><p>Although it is possible to work as a general counselor, helping clients in an array of situations, facing a variety of issues, many professionals on the verge of entering the field look to specialize, Lynne Shallcross explained in an article for Counseling Today. Deciding what specialization to select, if any, can be a challenging decision. It can help, therefore, to take a closer look at some of the major specialization areas in which counselors work.</p><p></p><p>Why specialize?</p><p>Before reviewing notable specialization areas, it is important to examine the reasons why some counseling professionals opt to specialize in a certain area. In her article for Counseling Today, Shallcross interviewed Barbara Adams, a therapist currently working with children in Alabama. Shallcross learned that Adams’ career has featured stints working as both a specialized counselor and a general counselor. Shallcross also received Adams’ professional opinion on some of the major benefits of working in a specialized field, as well as some of the drawbacks. Adams’ reasoning is as follows:</p><p></p><p></p><p>Pros:</p><p>Adams explained that opting to specialize can breed a sense of intimacy and familiarity with the topic and issue at hand, which can boost a counselor’s confidence that she or he is providing the very best care to clients.</p><p>Through a specialization, it is possible for a counselor to become a leader in a certain area, providing guidance and education to other counselors.</p><p>Individuals who follow a specialty tend to have a passion for that particular issue, whether it may be marriage and family counseling or substance abuse counseling. As Adams makes clear, counselors who are passionate about a certain area tend to be more invested and dedicated to their role, providing better counseling services as a consequence. As she explained, “With specializing, I learned that it is important to follow your passion in practice. If you are drawn to and wind up doing what you enjoy, you are a more effective counselor, and those to whom you provide services are the real winners.”Shallcross also interviewed Tamara Suttle, a counselor who works in Colorado. Suttle explained that many counselors often will opt to specialize — to find a niche — in order to increase their commercial viability. Conversely, however, the same rationale can be applied when deciding to generalize.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Achieving good reproductive health remains a far-off goal in many parts of the world. This lack of care has repercussions. An estimated 830 women die of pregnancy-related causes each day, amounting to more than 300,000 deaths each year; 99% of these deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries.(1) However, access to family planning can greatly reduce these mortality rates. One 2012 study found that contraceptive use caused a 44% reduction in maternal mortality in 2008; these researchers also predicted that providing access to contraception for all those who need it would reduce worldwide maternal deaths by 29%.(2) These statistics call for increased access to reproductive health and family planning services.</p><br />
