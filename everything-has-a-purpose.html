Since there is a fast- paced living in the area, it is possible that condominium living has been the trend for many due to the access it provides for inhabitants to go to business and education districts such as Manila, Quezon City, and Makati . The increase of condominiums around the area could also be a result of the density of people, predominantly students, given that De La Salle University, one of the country's top universities, is located along Taft Avenue.

</p><p>The imperative mood is a grammatical mood that forms a command or request. An example of a verb used in the imperative mood is the English phrase "Go." Such imperatives imply a second-person subject, but some other languages also have first- and third-person imperatives, with the meaning of "let's" or "let them".
</p><p>
</p><p>In English grammar, a declarative sentence is a sentence that makes a statement, provides a fact, offers an explanation, or conveys information. ... A declarative sentence is the most common type of sentence in the English language. It is written in the present tense and usually ends with a period.
