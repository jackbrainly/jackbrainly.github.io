Dr Angelo Jesus Arias, a psychiatrist based in Dumaguete City and a director of the Philippine Psychiatric Association, says the number, and distribution, of mental health workers is the most concerning aspect of the current situation. ______17. As COVID-19 continues its rampant run across Filipino communities, it’s predicted that cases of anxiety and depression will spike, and the country's mental healthcare systems may be totally unprepared. ______18. MANILA, Philippines - With the Philippines poised to endure unprecedented periods of quarantine, isolation, and uncertainty, experts are now bracing for a nationwide mental health epidemic. ______19. Dr Arias remained assured that he, and other clinicians, will continue to do all they can to treat patients that come their way.  But until the government changes course, the mental health of millions of Filipinos will hang totally in the balance. – Rappler.com ______ 20. If you look at the composition of psychiatrists in the Philippines, there are only 600 for a population of over 100 million. 400 of those are in Metro Manila. So, mental health and psychiatric care was already a massive challenge for provincial areas and other cities even before the pandemic, let alone now when the risk of succumbing to mental illness is greater,” he said. ​</a>

                                            Read the paragraph carefully. Then choose the correct answer on the following questions.
 Pasay City is considered the gateway to the Philippines by air. The Ninoy Aquino International Airport lies within its confines. Within its limited area of only 19 square kilometers live 386,702 residents. Squeezed into it are five colleges and universities, seven flying schools and public and private hospitals.
 Pasay has had a long and colorful history. In pre Spanish time, Rajah Soliman named it after his daughter, princess Pasay. A greater part of Pasay formed part of Nanayan, now St. Ana, a trading upstream along the Pasig River.
In 1727 Pasay was annexed to Malate to provide easier access to the Malate Parish. It was also at this time that Pasay was named Pineda, a Spanish landowner of the place who provided protection for the town people. At that time marauding brigands attacked and victimized many residents.
 Pasay has grown by accretion. On October 12, 1903, the Municipality of Malibay, earlier created on Feb. 2, 1889, was annexed to the Municipality of Pasay. Then ,on January 1,1942 Pasay was incorporated into greater Manila.
After the Second World War . In 1945 , Pasay reverted as a Municipality of Rizal province.
 On August 16,1947, it became a city by virtue of Republic Act No. 183 and was renamed Rizal City. But three years later in 1950, it reverted to its former name Pasay City.
 Pasay City celebrated its 130th anniversary on December 2, 1993, as a pueblo or town, for it was on this day 130 years ago when civil and ecclesiastical 
authorities allowed the residents to manage their political and religious affairs. Now Pasay City contributes much of the country’s prosperity and progress.

It must be noted also that the approximate lead time to expect the range of the wind speeds given for each signal number is valid only when the signal number is put in effect for the first time. Thus, the associated meteorological conditions are still expected in at least 18 hours with PSWS #3. The lead time shortens correspondingly in the subsequent issues of the warning bulletin when the signal number remains in effect as the tropical cyclone comes closer.</strong></p><p><strong>-</strong><strong>-</strong><strong>-</strong><strong>-</strong><strong>---------------------------------</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Alam</strong><strong> </strong><strong>ko</strong><strong> </strong><strong>po</strong><strong> </strong><strong>hindi</strong><strong> </strong><strong>niyo</strong><strong> </strong><strong>na</strong><strong> </strong><strong>po</strong><strong> </strong><strong>need</strong><strong> </strong><strong>ng</strong><strong> </strong><strong>explanation</strong><strong> </strong><strong>pero</strong><strong> </strong><strong>para</strong><strong> </strong><strong>maintindihan</strong><strong> </strong><strong>niyo</strong><strong> </strong><strong>po</strong><strong> </strong><strong>nilagay</strong><strong> </strong><strong>ko</strong><strong> </strong><strong>napo</strong><strong> </strong><strong>diyan</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Pa brainliest</strong><strong> </strong><strong>nadin</strong><strong> </strong><strong>po</strong><strong> </strong><strong>sana</strong><strong> </strong><strong>hehe</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>salamat</strong><strong> </strong><strong>po</strong><strong>☺</strong></p><p></p><br />

Dr Angelo Jesus Arias, a psychiatrist based in Dumaguete City and a director of the Philippine Psychiatric Association, says the number, and distribution, of mental health workers is the most concerning aspect of the current situation. ______17. As COVID-19 continues its rampant run across Filipino communities, it’s predicted that cases of anxiety and depression will spike, and the country's mental healthcare systems may be totally unprepared. ______18. MANILA, Philippines - With the Philippines poised to endure unprecedented periods of quarantine, isolation, and uncertainty, experts are now bracing for a nationwide mental health epidemic. ______19. Dr Arias remained assured that he, and other clinicians, will continue to do all they can to treat patients that come their way.  But until the government changes course, the mental health of millions of Filipinos will hang totally in the balance. – Rappler.com ______ 20. If you look at the composition of psychiatrists in the Philippines, there are only 600 for a population of over 100 million. 400 of those are in Metro Manila. So, mental health and psychiatric care was already a massive challenge for provincial areas and other cities even before the pandemic, let alone now when the risk of succumbing to mental illness is greater,” he said. ​</h2><br />

                            19. Read the paragraph carefully. Then choose the correct answer on the following questions.
 Pasay City is considered the gateway to the Philippines by air. The Ninoy Aquino International Airport lies within its confines. Within its limited area of only 19 square kilometers live 386,702 residents. Squeezed into it are five colleges and universities, seven flying schools and public and private hospitals.
 Pasay has had a long and colorful history. In pre Spanish time, Rajah Soliman named it after his daughter, princess Pasay. A greater part of Pasay formed part of Nanayan, now St. Ana, a trading upstream along the Pasig River.
In 1727 Pasay was annexed to Malate to provide easier access to the Malate Parish. It was also at this time that Pasay was named Pineda, a Spanish landowner of the place who provided protection for the town people. At that time marauding brigands attacked and victimized many residents.
 Pasay has grown by accretion. On October 12, 1903, the Municipality of Malibay, earlier created on Feb. 2, 1889, was annexed to the Municipality of Pasay. Then ,on January 1,1942 Pasay was incorporated into greater Manila.
After the Second World War . In 1945 , Pasay reverted as a Municipality of Rizal province.
 On August 16,1947, it became a city by virtue of Republic Act No. 183 and was renamed Rizal City. But three years later in 1950, it reverted to its former name Pasay City.
 Pasay City celebrated its 130th anniversary on December 2, 1993, as a pueblo or town, for it was on this day 130 years ago when civil and ecclesiastical 
authorities allowed the residents to manage their political and religious affairs. Now Pasay City contributes much of the country’s prosperity and progress.
