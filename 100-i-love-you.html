did you believe in FIRST LOVE NEVER DIE? (kase ako 100% percent naniniwala based on my experience)
what if one day you meet her/him again (your first love) then you realize na you still love her/him, and you are desperate to make that person back. Pero nalaman mo na taken na sya. (ofcoure kelangan natin ng distance diba) PERO nalaman mo na sobrang alanganin na ng relasyon nila. (Syempre kelngan nya ng katulad mo para icomfort sya dba, pero wala ka namng intensyon na paghiwalayin sila, kundi pag ayusin lang sila) PERO what if may nangyari sa inyo? ANONG GAGAWIN MO?</a>

                                            What's MoreActivity 2: My DefinitionStudy the definition below and answer the questions that followFor me, the word love means trust, friendship, and unselfishness. Firstof all, love means trust because when you trust someone, you can talk tohim/her about anything. For example, I trust my girlfriend 100%. It isbecause I trust her that I know I can tell her anything, and that is why I loveher. Furthermore, I believe that love means friendship because the peoplewho you spend time with are your friends, and if you do not love them, thenwhy would you hang out with them? To illustrate, I love my two best friendsbecause they are like brothers to me. We are always laughing andprotecting each other. Finally, love means unselfishness because whenyou love someone and they love you back, there should always besharing. For instance, my next-door neighbor's wife never shares anythingwith her husband, such as food, drinks, possessions, etc. I sure do not seea whole lot of love there. For me, love means the above three things(Pardede. 2011).1. What is the word being defined?2. How was the definition being expanded?3. Do you agree on how the word is being defined?​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>What's the hardest thing you've been thru?</p><p></p><p>There’s been too many to mention. If I wrote a book no one would believe what I’ve been through and how I came through it. One thing is, when you go down hard, you come back up, you are stronger and wiser. What I’ve learned is, you have to experience life, and each experience, I’ve always managed to help people, because I’ve been where that person is going through. Every reading I’ve ever had with a medium, tells me the same thing! What you’ve been through is not your fault. I came to terms with my life, as a soul journey. I believe you choose before we’re born, what work you will do, and the best way to help people. I also believe, if you can do something good once a day, however big or small, you make a difference, even a smile, can make a difference. I look on my life, that I make a difference, whether it’s for Humanity or Animal Kingdom, Mother Earth Gaia. I was an only child, but I’ve never been on my soul journey on my own, God, Archangels, Angels, Jesus and the Grand Masters, I put my hands in theirs, and I walk my life path with them. From a very early age, I knew this, and kept me safe and loved. It comes down to one thing, that I learned was, all it takes is, Love, Faith and Trust. God and the Higher Realms Will Never Let You Dow. I send you the Golden Light the White Light and the Violet Flame.</p><p></p><p>

                            22. What's MoreActivity 2: My DefinitionStudy the definition below and answer the questions that followFor me, the word love means trust, friendship, and unselfishness. Firstof all, love means trust because when you trust someone, you can talk tohim/her about anything. For example, I trust my girlfriend 100%. It isbecause I trust her that I know I can tell her anything, and that is why I loveher. Furthermore, I believe that love means friendship because the peoplewho you spend time with are your friends, and if you do not love them, thenwhy would you hang out with them? To illustrate, I love my two best friendsbecause they are like brothers to me. We are always laughing andprotecting each other. Finally, love means unselfishness because whenyou love someone and they love you back, there should always besharing. For instance, my next-door neighbor's wife never shares anythingwith her husband, such as food, drinks, possessions, etc. I sure do not seea whole lot of love there. For me, love means the above three things(Pardede. 2011).1. What is the word being defined?2. How was the definition being expanded?3. Do you agree on how the word is being defined?​</h2><br />
